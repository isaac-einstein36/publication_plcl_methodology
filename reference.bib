	abstract={The present study evaluates biodegradation of the polyblends of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) in different compositions and comparison of the properties of those blends with that of neat PLA and neat PCL. The samples were melt extruded and blended to evaluate the environmental fate of the polyblends under simulated composting conditions following the standard ASTM International D5338-15 protocol. It was seen that blends with a higher concentration of PCL and MCC in the PLA matrix showed higher carbon mineralization percentage in comparison to the blends having low PCL and MCC components. Molecular weight analysis of the samples showed a decrease in their weight due to chain scission mechanism leading to the formation of intermediates. Analytical techniques revealed the formation of microbial biofilms on the blended biopolymeric surfaces. Field emission scanning electron microscopy showed the formation of fibril-like structures by PLA, and the formation of rough patches on the PCL surface re-confirmed biodegradation of the samples. This work fuels interest in the material characterization of PLA/PCL/MCC based polyblends and helps in tuning the biodegradability of the studied samples according to the demands. [Display omitted] •This study demonstrates PCL/PLA/MCC:80/20/3 as best compostable material.•Study was conducted under composting condition at thermophilic temperature.•This study demonstrated biofilm formation.•Surface morphological changes were observed for all the test samples.•Study demonstrated formation of fibril like morphology on PLA based surfaces.},

Recently in automotive applications there has been a trend to power several accessories with a single drive belt in order to reduce overall vehicle size and weight. Since these belts are typically longer than conventional belts, a tensioner component is added to maintain acceptable belt tension levels. In this paper we describe several potential instability mechanisms for belt-tensioner systems, and present a design methodology to ensure good dynamic performance of such systems. A mathematical model of the belt-tensioner system, and numerical solution methods, are utilized to develop a computer-aided design procedure. Numerical results, and confirming experimental data, are presented for a particular automotive belt-tensioner system.},

  title    = {Nanosizing of drugs: Effect on dissolution rate},
  abstract = {The solubility, bioavailability and dissolution rate of drugs are important parameters for achieving in vivo efficiency. The bioavailability of orally administered drugs depends on their ability to be absorbed via gastrointestinal tract. For drugs belonging to Class II of pharmaceutical classification, the absorption process is limited by drug dissolution rate in gastrointestinal media. Therefore, enhancement of the dissolution rate of these drugs will present improved bioavailability. So far several techniques such as physical and chemical modifications, changing in crystal habits, solid dispersion, complexation, solubilization and liquisolid method have been used to enhance the dissolution rate of poorly water soluble drugs. It seems that improvement of the solubility properties ofpoorly water soluble drugscan translate to an increase in their bioavailability. Nowadays nanotechnology offers various approaches in the area of dissolution enhancement of low aqueous soluble drugs. Nanosizing of drugs in the form of nanoparticles, nanocrystals or nanosuspensions not requiring expensive facilities and equipment or complicated processes may be applied as simple methods to increase the dissolution rate of poorly water soluble drugs. In this article, we attempted to review the effects of nanosizing on improving the dissolution rate of poorly aqueous soluble drugs. According to the reviewed literature, by reduction of drug particle size into nanometer size the total effective surface area is increased and thereby dissolution rate would be enhanced. Additionally, reduction of particle size leads to reduction of the diffusion layer thickness surrounding the drug particles resulting in the increment of the concentration gradient. Each of these process leads to improved bioavailability.}

A similar methodology can be adapted for the compositional analysis of copolymers, so long as the resonance signals from different monomers can be clearly differentiated. Due to poor molecular rotation and marginally different chemical environments in which the repeating units are situated, resonance signals from polymer repeating units often coalesce as a broad peak, even using high-field NMR spectrometers. 3 However, in the molecular weight analysis and compositional analysis, collective signals from polymer repeating units are used for calculation and monomeric resolution is generally not required. To that end, low-field NMR readily lends itself as a low-cost alternative to high-field instruments, with significant savings on both instrument procurement and upkeep.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The purpose of this work was to determine the monomer type and the monomer ratio in a polypropylene-polyethylene blend. ANALYTICAL STRATEGY 13 C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was used to identify chemical structures and to calculate the monomer ratio in the sample. CONCLUSIONS Carbon NMR was successfully applied to determine the monomer type in a suspected polypropylene-polyethylene blend. The sample was found to contain signals for propylene, ethyelene and hexene (butyl branches). The monomer ratio in the sample was found to be ~ 74.2 ethylene, ~ 24.4\% of polypropylene and ~ 1.4\% of hexyl monomer. The sample is most consistent with a polypropylene homopolymer and a linear low density polyethyelene containing hexyl comonomer.}

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing such as 3D printing is considered as a highly convenient manufacturing process since it enables to create any 3D objects. It is known that different materials, printing techniques, and printing parameters are affecting the mechanical properties of the printed objects. However, studies on the mechanical properties of the 3D printed structure are still limited. In this work, investigation of the relationship between two printing parameters, i.e. infill pattern and infill density were conducted on the Polylactic Acid (PLA) material. Three infill densities, 25\%, 50\%, and 75\%, and three infill patterns, grid, tri-hexagon, and concentric, were chosen. The tensile test, ASTM D638, was employed to obtain the material properties based on these two printing parameters. An open-source 3D printing slicer software, Cura, was used to manufacture the tensile specimens. The Young's modulus, yield strength, and ultimate strength were recorded and examined. The results showed that the tensile properties increase as infill density increases. Of the three-printing pattern, the concentric has the highest values of tensile properties regardless of the infill densities. This finding can be used as a reference for creating a finite element model (FEM) as well as predicting the optimum tensile properties with respect to the printing parameters.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is an innovative procedure that can quickly create complex structures. By layering a material, a three-dimensional object is created using this technique. Every deposit of liquefied or partly liquefied material abides by the previous deposit. Fused deposition modelling's (FDM) objective is to comprehend how varied interior structures influence the bending resistance of the printed samples and to investigate the impact of various infill patterns and percentages. The term "infill" describes the pattern of solid material used to fill a 3D-printed object's interior. It is utilized to give the printed part structural support and strength. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material was chosen for this study as it offers a greater and superior finished plane along with dimensional stability. The infill pattern chosen for the flexural test study was the triangular pattern which includes different densities of infill percentages precisely, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%. A few specimens of ABS material having 100\% infill density are put through a tensile test according to the ASTM D638. The ASTM D790 standard was used to make a model and test the flexural strength of the specimen. Line and triangle patterns provided the most ideal tensile and bending strength properties. This is likely because the deposited rasters are associated with the direction of loading. For line patterns with 100\% infill, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed a convincing connection between the microstructures and the rasters (porosity, voids, gap between beads and hole due to polymer pulled out). Furthermore, SEM analysis showed matrix failure and significant voids in a triangular pattern at infill densities of 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%.},

In the experimental design (L8), four different layer thickness (0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25 mm), extruder temperature (250 and 260°C), filling structure (Rectilinear and Full Honeycomb), and occupancy rate (25 and 50\%) were determined. The tensile and impact strength test samples were printed with the FDM method. Tensile and impact strength of the test samples were carried out according to ISO 527 and ISO 180 test standards. The findings obtained from tests were analyzed and compared. As a result, the layer thickness is most effective factor for enhance the mechanical properties instead extruder temperature, occupancy rate, and filling structure. The optimum tensile strength of determined for process parameters (layer thickness, occupancy rates, filling structures and extruder temperature) were 0.25 mm, 50\%, Rectilinear, and 250°C, respectively. The optimum impact strength of determined for process parameters (layer thickness, occupancy rates, extruder temperature, and filling structures) were 0.25 mm, 50\%, 250°C, and Rectilinear, respectively. PA12 filament material can be used to printing for sleeve bearing due to their mechanical properties. It can be used in the production of many machine parts and components due to its tensile strength, impact strength resistance and damping properties.},

As FDM process parameters, filaments (PLA, Re-PLA), three different layer thicknesses (0.15–0.20–0.25 mm), occupancy rates (30\%, 50\% and 70\%), and filling structure (Rectilinear) were determined in the experimental design.

The tensile, three-point bending, and impact strength of the test parts were determined using the ISO 527, ISO 180, and ISO 178 test standards, respectively. The results showed that layer thickness is the most efficient factor for improving tensile strength, three point bending strength, and impact strength rather than occupancy rate or filament materials. The optimum results were obtained in layer thickness (0.25 mm), occupancy rate (70\%), and filament material (PLA), respectively. They were calculated to be as 60.006 MPa at tensile strength, 125.423 MPa at three-point bending strength, 16.961 kJ/m2 at izod impact strength. Also, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) has been utilized to investigate the morphology and topography alterations in the fractured surface of test parts.

  number   = {1},
  abstract = {Purging is a fundamental process in the injection molding sector, aiding in color transition, material shifts, and the removal of contaminants. The purging compounds can be classified according to physical or chemical mechanisms and are affected by processing parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or soaking period. Despite some studies on the effect of processing parameters in purging action, an analysis of the rheological behavior and physico-chemical changes is still required for a deeper understanding of this type of system. This study explored shear viscosity, activation energy behavior in the torque rheometer, injection molding process, and energy consumption for two polyolefin-based purging compounds: one on polypropylene (PP) and another on polyethylene (PE). The results showed that the PP-based compound is a highly viscous material with low thermal sensibility and low energy consumption. The PE-based chemical compound, which includes an expanding and scrubbing agent, presented higher thermal sensitivity. Lower purging times and specific energy consumption were observed for the mechanical purge regardless of the processing temperature in the injection molding machine. However, torque and specific total mechanical energy differed due to viscosity and possible filler particle agglomeration. These findings demonstrated the influence of processing temperature on rheology and performance. Nonetheless, further studies regarding pressure, soaking time, and rheological modeling are recommended.},

  abstract = {The growing demand for sustainable materials as substitutes for conventional materials has led to the need for sustainable manufacturing practices that can effectively balance the use of limited resources and reduce environmental impact while maintaining economic viability and promoting human welfare. Therefore, the use of recycled polylactic acid (rPLA) in 3D printing could be a promising solution for reducing the cost and environmental impact of the use of virgin PLA in 3D printing. However, the low strength of recycled PLA-printed components remains a challenge. In addition, the use of PLA in 3D printing may pose environmental, cost, and social issues. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the mechanical properties and sustainability potential of recycled PLA. Hence, this study aimed to provide an overview of the potential use of recycled PLA in 3D printing. To achieve this goal, this study followed a systematic review approach and analysed published academic research papers to discuss the degradation of thermal and mechanical properties, challenges and opportunities of PLA recycling, and sustainability aspects of additively manufactured PLA products. Studies have shown that recycled PLA can be an alternative to virgin PLA if its properties can be appropriately modified and controlled. Researchers have used different methods to upgrade the properties of recycled PLA, such as using virgin and recycled waste blends, altering the printing process parameters, and utilising additives. In addition, the sustainability implications of using recycled PLA for 3D printing have not been adequately discussed. The findings indicate that the majority of research has concentrated on evaluating the environmental aspect, while paying scant attention to economic and social dimensions. Further research is required to understand the environmental, economic, and social impacts of recycled PLA on 3D printing. The findings of this study will assist practitioners and academics in thinking about using recycled materials and adapting them to obtain desired qualities.},

Three breast radiotherapy techniques using 6MV tangential photon beams were compared: (a) 2DRT (open rectangular fields), (b) 3DCRT (conformal wedged fields), and (c) hybrid IMRT (open conformal+modulated fields). Over 35 organs were contoured in a whole-body CT scan and organ-specific dose distributions were determined with MC and the TPS. Large differences in out-of-field doses were observed between MC and TPS calculations, even for organs close to the target volume such as the heart, the lungs and the contralateral breast (up to 70\% difference). MC simulations showed that a large fraction of the out-of-field dose comes from the out-of-field head scatter fluence (>40\%) which is not adequately modeled by the TPS. Based on MC simulations, the 3DCRT technique using external wedges yielded significantly higher doses (up to a factor 4–5 in the pelvis) than the 2DRT and the hybrid IMRT techniques which yielded similar out-of-field doses. In sharp contrast to popular belief, the IMRT technique investigated here does not increase the out-of-field dose compared to conventional techniques and may offer the most optimal plan. The 3DCRT technique with external wedges yields the largest out-of-field doses. For accurate out-of-field dose assessment, a commercial TPS should not be used, even for organs near the target volume (contralateral breast, lungs, heart).},

  title    = {Effect of x-ray energy on the radiological image quality in propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography of the breast},
  abstract = {Purpose: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in developing and developed countries and is responsible for 15\% of women's cancer deaths worldwide. Conventional absorption-based breast imaging techniques lack sufficient contrast for comprehensive diagnosis. Propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography (PB-CT) is a developing technique that exploits a more contrast-sensitive property of x-rays: x-ray refraction. X-ray absorption, refraction, and contrast-to-noise in the corresponding images depend on the x-ray energy used, for the same/fixed radiation dose. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between xray energy and radiological image quality in PB-CT imaging. Approach: Thirty-nine mastectomy samples were scanned at the imaging and medical beamline at the Australian Synchrotron. Samples were scanned at various x-ray energies of 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, and 60 keV using a Hamamatsu Flat Panel detector at the same object-to-detector distance of 6 m and mean glandular dose of 4 mGy. A total of 132 image sets were produced for analysis. Seven observers rated PB-CT images against absorption-based CT (AB-CT) images of the same samples on a five-point scale. A visual grading characteristics (VGC) study was used to determine the difference in image quality. Results: PB-CT images produced at 28, 30, 32, and 34 keV x-ray energies demonstrated statistically significant higher image quality than reference AB-CT images. The optimum x-ray energy, 30 keV, displayed the largest area under the curve ðAUC VGC Þ of 0.754 (p ¼ 0.009). This was followed by 32 keV (AUC VGC ¼ 0.731, p ≤ 0.001), 34 keV (AUC VGC ¼ 0.723, p ≤ 0.001), and 28 keV (AUC VGC ¼ 0.654, p ¼ 0.015). Conclusions: An optimum energy range (around 30 keV) in the PB-CT technique allows for higher image quality at a dose comparable to conventional mammographic techniques. This results in improved radiological image quality compared with conventional techniques, which may ultimately lead to higher diagnostic efficacy and a reduction in breast cancer mortalities.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is a kind of aggressive cancer that significantly affects women worldwide, thus making research on alternative and new therapies necessary. The potential impact of bee venom on breast cancer is the main subject of this analysis of this research article. Bee venom has drawn the attention of the world with the help of its constituent ingredients, namely the bioactive compounds, enzymes, and complex blend of proteins. They have a particularly varied chemical makeup and proven anti-cancer capabilities. This is a detailed review demonstrating the components of bee venom and their individual functions in fighting cancer, as well as the results of previously conducted in-vitro and in-vivo research. As described later, bee venom has given positive results in triggering apoptosis, preventing cell migration, inhibiting metastasis and invasion, and suppressing the existing breast cancer cells. It is found to have worked better along with the already existing chemotherapy treatments. These results were also proved with the help of various animal studies that showed reduced tumor development, reduced metastasis, and improved therapeutic effectiveness. Furthermore, certain studies and case reports from all over the world have exhibited consistent results in females affected by breast cancer. This study found that people receiving chemotherapy experienced improved health outcomes and reduced discomfort, with fewer negative side effects. It is important to conduct extensive research on the safety and effectiveness of this treatment because it is yet to be approved. The ideal dosage and administration methods must be explored in clinical trials. Moreover, it is imperative to evaluate the results of any combined treatments with current medications. There should be constant monitoring to prevent any potential side effects. Other important things like allergic reactions and hidden concerns should also be considered.},

A commercially available radiopaque FFF filament had been hard to find. This study aims to report, step-by-step, the development of a radiopaque FFF filament.

The filament was homogenized and characterized by analyzing its density and images obtained using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Computed Tomography (CT) and micro-CT (µCT) scans. Three filaments were produced with different Hounsfield Units (HU) equivalences: XCT-A (1607HU), XCT-B (1965HU) and XCT-C (2624HU) with respective densities of 1.166(6) g/cm³, 1.211(2) g/cm³ and 1.271(3) g/cm³.

  abstract = {The study was carried out by numerical integration based on the diffraction properties and elemental composition. The elemental compositions of breast tissues in the literature were tested. The photon attenuation coefficients calculated using the recent elemental composition were found within 0.2-16\% for adipose tissue and within 0.04-17\% for glandular tissue with the experimental reference data. The attenuation coefficients of cancerous breast tissue calculated according to the elemental content previously measured in breast cancer patients were found within 0-17\% with experimental data in the literature. The attenuation coefficients are of great interest to medical research. To calculate realistic attenuation coefficients, the characteristic coherent scatter, which is most intense at small angles, must be considered. For this reason, experimentally measured form factor data were reviewed, and the most compatible one with the theoretical form factor data produced in this study was used at low momentum transfer x (0 < x ≤ 8 nm-1). The differential linear coherent scattering distributions were calculated for an energy value of 17.44 keV and compared with their experimental counterparts.},

The Klein-Nishina formula was used in the entire calculation. The results show that the Klein-Nishina electronic cross-section (e σ) decreases with increasing photon energy. Due to the complex variation in the effective charge number Z of the tissues, the Klein-Nishina atomic cross-section (a σ) first increases and then decreases for the investigated tissues. The Compton mass attenuation coefficient (σ/ρ) has even more complexity when the calculated values of σ/ρ are analyzed as a function of increasing Z/A for the investigated tissues. An overall trend of increase in σ/ρ is observed for increasing Z/A for all tissues except the cortical bone. In the case of the cortical bone, the values of σ/ρ decrease since cortical bone is a relatively high Z tissue as compared to other tissues where a rapid increase in the effective mass number A occurs when Z is increased. Overall, the results are very useful in calculating and delivering precise and optimum doses to avoid image quality degradation in radiographic images and to treat a tumor more effectively while keeping the normal tissues safe in radiation treatment planning.},

  journal  = {Materials},
  volume   = {17},
  number   = {12},
  abstract = {Three-dimensional printing technologies are becoming increasingly attractive for their versatility; the geometrical customizability and manageability of the final product properties are the key points. This work aims to assess the feasibility of producing radiopaque filaments for fused deposition modeling (FDM), a 3D printing technology, starting with zinc oxide (ZnO) and polylactic acid (PLA) as the raw materials. Indeed, ZnO and PLA are promising materials due to their non-toxic and biocompatible nature. Pellets of PLA and ZnO in the form of nanoparticles were mixed together using ethanol; this homogenous mixture was processed by a commercial extruder, optimizing the process parameters for obtaining mechanically stable samples. Scanning electron microscopy analyses were used to assess, in the extruded samples, the homogenous distribution of the ZnO in the PLA matrix. Moreover, X-ray microtomography revealed a certain homogenous radiopacity; this imaging technique also confirmed the correct distribution of the ZnO in the PLA matrix. Thus, our tests showed that mechanically stable radiopaque filaments, ready for FDM systems, were obtained by homogenously loading the PLA with a maximum ZnO content of 6.5\% wt. (nominal). This study produced multiple outcomes. We demonstrated the feasibility of producing radiopaque filaments for additive manufacturing using safe materials. Moreover, each phase of the process is cost-effective and green-oriented; in fact, the homogenous mixture of PLA and ZnO requires only a small amount of ethanol, which evaporates in minutes without any temperature adjustment. Finally, both the extruding and the FDM technologies are the most accessible systems for the additive manufacturing commercial apparatuses.},

  title    = {Radiopaque filaments for Fused Filament Fabrication ({FFF}) {3D} Printing},
  abstract = {Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a chemically resistant polymer with excellent thermal and mechanical properties, increasingly used for the development of 3D-printed medical implants and radiotherapeutic devices. Although PEEK exhibits resistance to radiation-induced degradation, it expresses poor radiation-blocking capacity. However, many devices and tools in radiology, radiotherapy, and nuclear medicine, such as brachytherapy implants, shields, screens, and personalised radioprotection equipment, require a certain level of radiopacity in either one of their components. This work describes a novel procedure for integrating electrondense particles (micro or nano-sized) into filaments for 3D printing (fused filament fabrication (FFF)) with high-performance polymers like PEEK. First, an original methodology was developed for optimal pre-mixing of micrometric-sized metal particles (here: tungsten) with micrometric-sized PEEK particles prior to their addition to millimetric-sized PEEK pellets. This mixture of three (3) types of particles allowed for high-temperature materials extrusion, producing continuous, robust filaments that isolate metal particles while embedding them in a structural, protective polymer. The filaments were characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence imaging for particle distribution homogeneity, and elemental analysis for radiation-blocking material content. Filaments achieving <10\% v/v in tungsten (W) were used to fabricate high-density 3D printed objects of varying thicknesses. Optimal 3D printing parameters were identified, and X-ray attenuation properties were measured via radiographic imaging. Lastly, primary human choroid fibroblast (CSF) cells put in contact four (4) days with 3D-printed W-loaded PEEK objects demonstrated a high level of biocompatibility, thus opening possibilities for 3D-printed radiopaque polymer for medical implants, in addition to aerospace, and nuclear applications.}

  abstract = {Background: Accuracy of tumor bed (TB) delineation is essential for targeting boost doses or partial breast irradiation. Multiple studies have shown high interobserver variability with standardly used surgical clip markers (CMs). We hypothesize that a radiopaque filament marker (FM) woven along the TB will improve TB delineation consistency. Methods: An FDA-approved FM was intraoperatively used to outline the TB of patients undergoing lumpectomy. Between January 2020 and January 2022, consecutive patients with FM placed after either (1) lumpectomy or (2) lumpectomy with oncoplastic reconstruction were identified and compared with those with CM. Six "experts" (radiation oncologists specializing in breast cancer) across 2 institutions independently defined all TBs. Three metrics (volume variance, dice coefficient, and center of mass [COM] deviation). Two-tailed paired samples t tests were performed to compare FM and CM cohorts. Results: Twenty-eight total patients were evaluated (14 FM and 14 CM). In aggregate, differences in volume between expert contours were 29.7\% (SD 58.8\%) with FM and 55.4\% (SD 105.9\%) with CM (P < 0.001). The average dice coefficient in patients with FM was 0.54 (SD 0.15), and with CM was 0.44 (SD 0.22) (P < 0.001). The average COM deviation was 0.63 cm (SD 0.53 cm) for FM and 1.05 cm (SD 0.93 cm) for CM; (P < 0.001). In the subset of patients who underwent lumpectomy with oncoplastic reconstruction, the difference in average volume was 21.8\% (SD 20.4\%) with FM and 52.2\% (SD 64.5\%) with CM (P < 0.001). The average dice coefficient was 0.53 (SD 0.12) for FM versus 0.39 (SD 0.24) for CM (P < 0.001). The average COM difference was 0.53 cm (SD 0.29 cm) with FM versus 1.25 cm (SD 1.08 cm) with CM (P < 0.001). Conclusion: FM consistently outperformed CM in the setting of both standard lumpectomy and complex oncoplastic reconstruction. These data suggest the superiority of FM in TB delineation.},

  title    = {Novel radiopaque poly (lactic acid) filament production for phantom applications, and model studies for hard tissues},
  abstract = {Purpose-The complex geometries of human tissues are characterized by the employment of phantoms in various fields of medicine ranging from active treatment stages to educational purposes. Despite the exceptional abilities of the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology to produce rapid and patient-specific complex anatomical models, the issue of human tissue-filament material incompatibilities persists owing to the lack of attenuation coefficients in the same range as biological tissues. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel biodegradable filament that can mimic human hard tissues by addressing the challenge mentioned above. Design/methodology/approach-The current study addresses the issue through proposing a novel biodegradable radiopaque filament containing poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and antimony trioxide (Sb 2 O 3) with increasing amounts (3 wt\%, 5 wt\% and 10 wt\%) for hard tissues. Other than the thermal/ flow characterization and internal structural analyses, as for evaluating the effectiveness of the produced filament under computed tomography (CT) imaging, two detailed anthropomorphic phantoms (L3 vertebra and femur bone) are produced and tested. Findings-Results show that Sb 2 O 3 disperse homogeneously and serve as a nucleating agent for PLA crystallization. Gyroid pattern gets very close isotropic structure with the highest hounsfield unit (HU) values. 5 wt\% Sb 2 O 3 is required to get the HU values of cortical bone. The produced model hard tissues are in very compatible with patient images in all details including cortical thickness. Practical implications-The results of this study will contribute to the development of radiopaque products in medical applications using threedimensional printing. Originality/value-The current research shows that inexpensive, patient-specific, detailed medical models can be produced with a novel biodegradable radiopaque filament containing PLA/Sb 2 O 3. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no study has examined the use of Sb 2 O 3 in radiopacity applications in any polymeric material.},

For this reason, it is widely used in medical and radiological fields. However, few materials with high electron density similar to that of bone exist for fabricating a human phantom. In this study, commercially available filament materials were used with an FDM 3D printer to perform delivery quality assurance (DQA) and were evaluated for medical use. For the bone filament material, BaSO 4 was synthesized in five ratios of 2\%, 4\%, 6\%, 8\%, and 10\% with 40\% PBAT and 50~58\% PLA. The electron density for the 3D printing material fabricated was obtained using kV energy CT and compared with the electron density of human organs and bones. The radiation beam properties of the 3D printed structures were analyzed as films for treatment using a linear accelerator. As a result, by changing the infill density of the material, it was possible to produce a material similar to the density of human organs, and a homogeneous bone material with HU values ranging from 371 ± 9 to 1013 ± 28 was produced. The 3D printing material developed in this study is expected to be usefully applied to the development of a patient-specific phantom to evaluate the accuracy of radiotherapy.},

  abstract = {Background: A shift towards less burdening and more patient friendly treatments for breast cancer is currently ongoing. In low-risk patients with early-stage disease, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an alternative for whole breast irradiation following breast-conserving surgery. MRI-guided single dose ablative APBI has the potential to offer a minimally burdening, non-invasive treatment that could replace current breast-conserving therapy. Methods: The ABLATIVE study is a prospective, single arm, multicenter study evaluating preoperative, single dose, ablative radiation treatment in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Patients with core biopsy proven non-lobular invasive breast cancer, (estrogen receptor positive, Her2 negative, maximum tumor size 3.0 cm on diagnostic MRI) and a negative sentinel node biopsy are eligible. Radiotherapy (RT) planning will be performed using a contrast enhanced (CE) planning CT-scan, co-registered with a CE-MRI, both in supine RT position. A total of twenty-five consecutive patients will be treated with a single ablative RT dose of 20 Gy to the tumor and 15 Gy to the tumorbed. Follow-up MRIs are scheduled within 1 week, 2, 4 and 6 months after single-dose RT. Breast-conserving surgery is scheduled at six months following RT. Primary study endpoint is pathological complete response. Secondary study endpoints are the radiological response and toxicity. Furthermore, patients will fill out questionnaires on quality of life and functional status. Cosmetic outcome will be evaluated by the treating radiation oncologist, patient and 'Breast Cancer Conservation Treatment cosmetic results' software. Recurrence and survival rates will be assessed. The patients will be followed up to 10 years after diagnosis. If patients give additional informed consent, a biopsy and a part of the irradiated specimen will be stored at the local Biobank and used for future research on radiotherapy response associated genotyping. Discussion: The ABLATIVE study evaluates MRI-guided single dose ablative RT in patients with early-stage breast cancer, aiming at a less burdening and non-invasive alternative for current breast-conserving treatment. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT02316561. The trial was registrated prospectively on October 10th 2014.},

During the breast lumpectomy procedure, surgeons traditionally elect to use either a superficial or full-thickness closure when sealing the wound depending on surgeon preference as well as desired outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine dosimetric endpoints in patients with superficial versus full-thickness closures with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Methods. Patients who underwent breast conservation surgery followed by 3D conformal external-beam APBI were identified (n = 45) and were separated according to the type of cavity closure performed: superficial and full thickness. Data gathered from the retrospective review of patient charts was analyzed according to criteria in the NSABP B-39 protocol in order to quantify the amount of radiation delivered to organs at risk. The patient seroma cavity was further given a cavity visualization score to assess the impact of wound closure on treatment planning. Results. There was no significant difference in the mean CVS score for the 2 groups. There were no statistical differences in all dosimetric endpoints compared for the 2 types of closure, and both groups met NSABP B-39 guidelines for the ipsilateral breast, heart, and ipsilateral lung dosimetry. Conclusions. We found no significant difference in dosimetric outcomes in either the superficial or deep closure treatment groups. Breast surgeons should not alter their preferred closure strategy in anticipation of 3D-CRT APBI.},

  abstract = {Polymers as biomaterials possess favorable properties, which include corrosion resistance, light weight, biocompatibility, ease of processing, low cost, and an ability to be easily tailored to meet specific applications. However, their inherent low X-ray attenuation, resulting from the low atomic numbers of their constituent elements, i.e., hydrogen (1), carbon (6), nitrogen (7), and oxygen (8), makes them difficult to visualize radiographically. Imparting radiopacity to radiolucent polymeric implants is necessary to enable noninvasive evaluation of implantable medical devices using conventional imaging methods. Numerous studies have undertaken this by blending various polymers with contrast agents consisting of heavy elements. The selection of an appropriate contrast agent is important, primarily to ensure that it does not cause detrimental effects to the relevant mechanical and physical properties of the polymer depending upon the intended application. Furthermore, its biocompatibility with adjacent tissues and its excretion from the body require thorough evaluation. We aimed to summarize the current knowledge on contrast agents incorporated into synthetic polymers in the context of implantable medical devices. While a single review was found that discussed radiopacity in polymeric biomaterials, the publication is outdated and does not address contemporary polymers employed in implant applications. Our review provides an up-to-date overview of contrast agents incorporated into synthetic medical polymers, encompassing both temporary and permanent implants. We expect that our results will significantly inform and guide the strategic selection of contrast agents, considering the specific requirements of implantable polymeric medical devices.},

  abstract = {Skin graft expansion is the key to the treatment of severe burn injuries requiring skin transplantation. While high expansions have been claimed by a majority of graft manufacturers, the realistic expansions reported to date with skin grafts are much lower. To clarify this discrepancy, we attempted to understand the biomechanics of skin grafts through the study of common graft pattern sizes, spacing, and orientation, and their influence on mesh expansion and induced stress. A novel skin simulant material and additive manufacturing were employed to develop the skin graft models. Tensile testing experiments were conducted to study expansion and overall stresses, and a finite element model (FEM) was used to characterize the local trends. At low strains (i.e., <1), the mesh expansion ratio was reported to be below 1, which increased up to 1.93 at a high strain of 2. The pattern size and spacing were not observed to affect the expansion much (i.e., <10\%). With a change in orientation, the expansion decreased across all graft models and strains. High localized induced stresses were reported for high strains, which varied with graft orientation. The novel observations highlight the achievable expansions without overstressing, with standard slit patterning in skin grafts. These findings will not only help achieve better mesh expansion outcomes in burn surgeries but also guide the development of novel graft patterns for enhanced expansion in the future.},

BioXmark ® has been clinically validated and reverse translated to preclinical models to improve cone-beam CT (CBCT) target delineation in small animal image-guided radiotherapy (SAIGRT). However, in phantom image analysis and in vivo evaluation of radiobiological response after the injection of BioXmark ® are yet to be reported. In phantom measurements were performed to compare CBCT imaging artefacts with solid fiducials and determine optimum imaging parameters for BioXmark ®. In vivo stability of BioXmark ® was assessed over a 5-month period, and the impact of BioXmark ® on in vivo tumour response from single-fraction and fractionated X-ray exposures was investigated in a subcutaneous syngeneic tumour model. BioXmark ® was stable, well tolerated and detectable on CBCT at volumes ≤10 µL. Our data showed imaging artefacts reduced by up to 84\% and 89\% compared to polymer and gold fiducial markers, respectively. BioXmark ® was shown to have no significant impact on tumour growth in control animals, but changes were observed in irradiated animals injected with BioXmark ® due to alterations in dose calculations induced by the sharp contrast enhancement. BioXmark ® is superior to solid fiducials with reduced imaging artefacts on CBCT. With minimal impact on the tumour growth delay, BioXmark ® can be implemented in SAIGRT to improve target delineation and reduce setup errors.},

  number   = {1},
  abstract = {Background In recent years, there has been a growing number of case reports documenting delayed seroma in patients with a history of breast surgery and reconstruction. The occurrence of these seromas has been associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. So far, there are few systematic analyses on postoperative complications in breast surgery since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Study design We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis to assess the incidence of postoperative complications in two major university breast care centers in Germany during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (August 1st, 2021, to January 31st, 2022) compared to a reference period (August 1st, 2019, to January 31st, 2020) before the pandemic. Results A total of 987 patients were included in this retrospective analysis, with 492 patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and 495 patients in the reference period. There was no significant difference in the incidence rate of seroma after breast surgery. However, complications such as erythema, wound infection, and wound healing disorders were notably more frequent during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Multivariate analysis revealed that increasing patient age, smoking, breast implant reconstruction, axillary lymph node dissection, and previous radiation were significant clinical risk factors for seroma development. Conclusion While our findings did not indicate an elevated incidence of seroma during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we observed increased rates of erythema, wound healing disorders, and wound infection. Additional real-world evidence is needed for understanding both early and late complications following breast surgery in the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 endemic.},

  abstract = {Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is an advanced 3D printing technique for the manufacture of plastic materials. The ease of use, prototyping accuracy and low cost makes it a widely used additive manufacturing technique. FDM creates 3D structures through the layer-by-layer melt-extrusion of a plastic filament. The production of a printed structure involves the generation of a digital design of the model by 3D design software and its execution by the printer until the complete model is reproduced. This review presents the current status of FDM, how to handle and operate FDM printers, industry standards of printing, the types of filaments that can be used, the post-processing treatments, advantages, and limitations as well as an overview of the increasing application fields of FDM technology. The application areas of FDM are endless, including biomedicine, construction, automotive, aerospace, acoustics, textiles, and occupational therapy amongst others. Even during the current Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, FDM has helped to fabricate face masks, ventilators and respiratory systems, respiratory valves, and nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 diagnosis. FDM 3D and 4D printing can produce polymeric and composite structures of various designs, and compositions in a range of materials according to the desired application. The review concludes by discussing the future prospects for FDM.},

In this study, poly(L-lactide-b-𝝐-caprolactone) block copolymers (bPLCL) with well-defined segment structure are obtained by a first synthesis of poly(𝝐-caprolactone) soft block, followed by ring opening polymerization of lactide to form poly(L-lactide acid) hard block. The pre-polymerization allows for fabrication of bPLCL with the definite compositions of soft/hard segment while preserving the individual segment of their special soft or hard segment. These priorities make the bPLCL afford biodegradable polymer with better mechanical and biodegradable controllability than the random poly(L-lactide-co-𝝐-caprolactone) (rPLCL) synthesized via traditional one-pot polymerization. 10 mol\% 𝝐-caprolactone introduction can result in a formation of an elastic polymer with elongation at break of 286.15\% ± 55.23\%. Also, bPLCL preserves the unique crystalline structure of the soft and hard segments to present a more sustainable biodegradability than the rPLCL. The combinative merits make the pre-polymerization technique a promising strategy for a scalable production of PLCL materials for potential biomedical application.},

  abstract = {In this study, the microinjection molding technology was adopted to prepare polylactic acid (PLA)/polycaprolactone (PCL)/bioactive glass (BG) composites with varying BG contents for biomedical applications. The various measurement techniques, including scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, the water contact angle (WCA) test, the mechanical test, and in vitro biological evaluations, were applied to characterize the above interesting biocomposites. The experimental results show that the extremely strong shear force field generated during the microinjection molding process could induce the in situ formation of micron PCL dispersed phase fibril structures and strongly promote the homogeneous dispersion of micron BG filler particles in the PLA/PCL polymer matrix, which therefore leads to a significant improvement in the specific mechanical property of the PLA/PCL/BG composite. For example, with BG fillers content increasing to 10 wt\%, the Young's modulus of the above obtained PLA/PCL/BG composite could reach 2122.9 MPa, which is 1.47 times higher than that of the unfilled PLA/PCL blend material. In addition, it is also found that under the simulated body fluid (SBF) environment, the incorporated BG fillers in the PLA/PCL polymer matrix could be effectively transformed into hydroxyapatite (HA) components on the treated sample surface, thus being greatly advantageous to enhancing the material's in vitro bioactivity. Obviously, the microinjection molded PLA/PCL/BG biocomposites could exhibit excellent comprehensive performance, revealing that the microinjection molding processing method could hold great potential in industrialization applications of the resulting biodegradable biomedical materials.},

  abstract = {Aim: To evaluate the impact of BioZorb ® , a 3Dbioabsorbable marker, on the tumor-bed boost volume and dosimetric parameters in adaptive boost planning for breast cancer. Patients and Methods: Records were reviewed for 51 breast-cancer patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant whole-breast irradiation between January 2017 and October 2018. Changes in lumpectomy boost volume (LBV), doses to organs at risk, toxicity and cosmesis were compared between patients with and without BioZorb ®. Chi-square test and paired and independent t-tests were used for comparisons of variables. Results: Median follow-up was 35.5 months. Mean LBV on initial CT (LBV1; 32.2 vs. 33.8 cc, p=0.74) and on boost computed tomography (CT) (LBV2; 25.3 vs. 24.8 cc, p=0.87) were similar with and without BioZorb ®. The mean decrease from LBV1 to LBV2 was 9.0 cc and 6.8 cc with and without BioZorb ® , respectively (p=0.42). LBV1 was significantly positively correlated with a 20\% reduction in LBV (p=0.02). Mean heart and lung doses on adaptive boost planning CT were slightly lower compared to initial planning CT in both groups. Acute breast pain was reported in 18/51 patients, 9 of whom had BioZorb ® (p=0.24). Grade-2 pain was reported in 5/51 patients, 3 of whom had BioZorb ® (p=0.11). Excellent or good cosmesis was reported in 36/41 patients. Fair cosmesis was reported in 5/41 patients, of whom 2 had BioZorb ® (p=0.64). Conclusion: BioZorb ® placement does not impact the tumor-bed boost volume nor the variation of seroma volume within the period of treatment. More data and longer follow-up are needed to identify a measurable clinical impact of BioZorb ® placement.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is a standard treatment for breast cancer. Currently, surgical clips are used to determine the tumour bed before radiotherapy planning. This study aimed to evaluate the migration of these clips on mammograms. Methods: The study was conducted on 121 females who were treated with radiotherapy after BCS at their first radiologic control examination 6 months after the end of treatment. MLO and CC views of all cases were evaluated regarding the clips. The distance between the surgical scar centre and the centre of the area covered by the clips was measured on both MLO and CC projections and recorded separately. This distance was determined as the clip displacement. A displacement ≤10 mm was recorded as no displacement. Results: The clips were out of the images and were not evaluated in 45 cases (37.2\%) on CC and in 9 cases (7.4\%) on MLO projections. There were no clip displacements in 37 (30.6\%) cases on CC and in 43 (35.5\%) cases on MLO views. The amount of displacement ranged from 11 to 56 mm with a mean of 24.38 mm on CC views, while on MLO projections, displacement ranged from 11 to 66 mm with a mean of 24.42 mm. Conclusion: A clip displacement of greater than 10 mm was found in 64.5\% of cases on MLO views. Therefore, we believe that the reliability of these clips for accurate delineation of the tumour bed in radiotherapy planning is controversial and other methods must be added.},

  abstract = {A soft and very elastic poly(lactide-co-"-caprolactone) (PLCL)(50 : 50, M n 185 £ 10 3) was synthesized. Tubular scaffolds were prepared by an extrusion-particulate leaching method for mechano-active vascular tissue engineering. The copolymer was very exible but completely rubberlike elastic. Even the high porous PLCL scaffolds (90\% salt wt) exhibited 200\% elongation, but recovery over 85\% in a tensile test. Moreover, the PLCL scaffolds maintained their high elasticity also in culture media under cyclic mechanical strain conditions. The highly porous scaffold (90\% salt wt) withstood for an initial 1 week without any deformation and sustained for 2 weeks in culture media under cyclic stress of 10\% amplitude and at 1 Hz frequency which are similar to the natural vascular conditions. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were seeded on to the PLCL scaffolds. The cell adhesion and proliferation on the scaffolds of various pore-size were increased with increasing pore size. For the pore sizes of 50-100 ¹m, 100-150 ¹m, 150-200 ¹m and 200-250 ¹m, the ratios of cell numbers were about 1 : 1.2 : 1.9 : 2.2, respectively, at both 12 h and 5 days. Similarly, the higher porous scaffolds exhibited more cell adhesion and proliferation compared to lower porous one, where the effect was more pronounced in the longer proliferation period. SMC-seeded scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in athymic nude mice to con rm the biocompatibility. Such a high elastic property and proper biocompatibility to SMCs of PLCL scaffolds prepared in this study will be very useful to engineer SM-containing tissues such as blood vessels under mechanically dynamic environments (mechano-active tissue engineering).}

  abstract = {Introduction Fractures of the proximal humerus represent a major osteoporotic burden. Recent developments in CT imaging have emphasized the importance of cortical bone thickness distribution in the prevention and management of fragility fractures. We aimed to experimentally define the CT density of cortical bone in the proximal humerus for building cortical geometry maps. Methods With ethical approval, we used ten fresh-frozen human proximal humeri. These were stripped of all soft tissue and high-resolution CT images were then taken. The humeral heads were then subsequently resected to allow access to the metaphyseal area. Using curettes, cancellous bone was removed down to hard cortical bone. Another set of CT images of the reamed specimen was then taken. Using CT imaging software and a CAD interface, we then compared cortical contours at different CT density thresholds to the reference inner cortical contour of our reamed specimens. Working with 3D model representations of these cortical maps, we were able to accurately make distance comparison analyses based on different CT thresholds. Results We could compute a single closest value at 700 HU. No difference was found in the HU-based contours generated along the 500-900 HU pixels (p=1.000). The contours were significantly different from those generated at 300, 400, 1,000, and 1,100 HU. Conclusions A Hounsfield range of 500-900 HU can accurately depict cortical bone geometry in the proximal humerus. Thresholding outside this range leads to statistically significant inaccuracies. Our results concur with a similar range reported in the literature for the proximal femur. Knowledge of regional variations in cortical bone thickness has direct implications for basic science studies on osteoporosis and its treatment, but is also important for the orthopedic surgeon since our decision for treatment options is often guided by local bone quality.},

  abstract = {Purpose Virtual reality (VR) can offer immersive platforms for segmenting complex medical images to facilitate a better understanding of anatomical structures for training, diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment evaluation. These applications rely on user interaction within the VR environment to manipulate and interpret medical data. However, the optimal interaction schemes and input devices for segmentation tasks in VR remain unclear. This study compares user performance and experience using two different input schemes. Methods Twelve participants segmented 6 CT/MRI images using two input methods: keyboard and mouse (KBM) and motion controllers (MCs). Performance was assessed using accuracy, completion time, and efficiency. A post-task questionnaire measured users' perceived performance and experience. Results No significant overall time difference was observed between the two input methods, though KBM was faster for larger segmentation tasks. Accuracy was consistent across input schemes. Participants rated both methods as equally challenging, with similar efficiency levels, but found MCs more enjoyable to use. Conclusion These findings suggest that VR segmentation software should support flexible input options tailored to task complexity. Future work should explore enhancements to motion controller interfaces to improve usability and user experience.},

  abstract = {The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) printed anatomical models has garnered interest in pre-operative planning, especially in orthopedic and trauma surgery. Identifying potential error sources and quantifying their effect on the model dimensional accuracy are crucial for the applicability and reliability of such models. In this study, twenty radii were extracted from anatomic forearm specimens and subjected to osteotomy to simulate a defined fracture of the distal radius (Colles' fracture). Various factors, including two different computed tomography (CT) technologies (energy-integrating detector (EID) and photon-counting detector (PCD)), four different CT scanners, two scan protocols (i.e., routine and high dosage), two different scan orientations, as well as two segmentation algorithms were considered to determine their effect on 3D model accuracy. Ground truth was established using 3D reconstructions of surface scans of the physical specimens. Results indicated that all investigated variables significantly impacted the 3D model accuracy (p < 0.001). However, the mean absolute deviation fell within the range of 0.03 ± 0.20 to 0.32 ± 0.23 mm, well below the 0.5 mm threshold necessary for pre-operative planning. Intra-and inter-operator variability demonstrated fair to excellent agreement for 3D model accuracy, with an intra-class correlation (ICC) of 0.43 to 0.92. This systematic investigation displayed dimensional deviations in the magnitude of sub-voxel imaging resolution for all variables. Major pitfalls included missed or overestimated bone regions during the segmentation process, necessitating additional manual editing of 3D models. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that 3D bone fracture models can be obtained with clinical routine scanners and scan protocols, utilizing a simple global segmentation threshold, thereby providing an accurate and reliable tool for pre-operative planning.},

Poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) is a bio-resorbable elastomeric copolymer with tailorable properties, which make this material an appropriate candidate to be used as scaffold for vascular, tendon, and nerve healing applications. Here, extrusion was applied to produce porous scaffolds of PLCL, using NaCl particles as a leachable agent. The effects of the particle proportion and size on leaching performance, dimensional stability, mechanical properties, and ageing of the scaffolds were analyzed. The efficiency of the particle leaching and scaffold swelling when wet were observed to be dependent on the porogenerator proportion, while the secant moduli and ultimate tensile strengths were dependent on the pore size. Porosity, swelling, and mechanical properties of the extruded scaffolds were tailorable, varying with the proportion and size of porogenerator particles and showed similar values to human soft tissues like nerves and veins (E = 7-15 MPa, σ u = 7 MPa). Up to 300-mm length micro-porous PLCL tube with 400-µm thickness wall was extruded, proving extrusion as a high-throughput manufacturing process to produce tubular elastomeric bio-resorbable porous scaffolds of unrestricted length with tunable mechanical properties.},

Magnetic resonance evaluation was performed at three and six months after chamber implantation. Chambers were removed at six months and samples were obtained for histological analysis. In one patient, newly formed tissue to a volume of 210 ml was generated inside the chamber. One patient was unable to complete the trial and the other three failed to develop significant enlargement of the original fat flap, which, at the time of chamber explantation, was encased in a thick fibrous capsule. Our study provides evidence that generation of large well-vascularized tissue engineered constructs using the TEC is feasible in humans.},

  abstract = {Background: Surface texture of a breast implant influences tissue response and ultimately device performance. Characterizing differences among available surface textures is important for predicting and optimizing performance. Methods: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray computed tomography (CT)-imaging were used to characterize the topography and surface area of 12 unique breast implant surface textures from seven different manufacturers. Samples of these surface textures were implanted in rats, and tissue response was analyzed histologically. In separate experiments, the force required to separate host tissue from the implant surface texture was used as a measure of tissue adherence. Results: SEM imaging of the top and cross section of the implant shells showed that the textures differed qualitatively in evenness of the surface, presence of pores, size and openness of the pores, and the depth of texturing. X-ray CT imaging reflected these differences, with the texture surface area of the anterior of the shells ranging from 85 to 551 mm 2 , which was 8-602\% greater than that of a flat surface. General similarities based on the physical structure of the surfaces were noted among groups of textures. In the rat models, with increasing surface texture complexity, there was increased capsule disorganization, tissue ingrowth, and tissue adherence. Conclusions: Surface area and topography of breast implant textures are important factors contributing to tissue ingrowth and adherence. Based on surface area characteristics and measurements, it is possible to group the textures into four classifications: smooth/nanotexture (80-100 mm 2), microtexture (100-200 mm 2), macrotexture (200-300 mm 2), and macrotexture-plus (> 300 mm 2).},

Novel implant surfaces and modifications of existing ones can directly impact cell-surface interactions and enhance biocompatibility and integration. The extent of foreign body response induced by breast implants influence implant success and integration into the body. This review highlights recent advances in breast implant surface technologies including modifications of implant surface topography and chemistry and effects on protein adsorption, and cell adhesion. A comprehensive online literature search was performed for relevant articles using the following keywords silicone breast implants, foreign body response, cell adhesion, protein adsorption, and cell-surface interaction. Properties of silicone breast implants impacting cellmaterial interactions including surface roughness, wettability, and stiffness, are discussed. Recent studies highlighting both silicone implant surface activation strategies and modifications to enhance biocompatibility in order to prevent capsular contracture formation and development of anaplastic large cell lymphoma are presented. Overall, breast implant surface modifications are being extensively investigated in order to improve implant biocompatibility to cater for increased demand for both cosmetic and oncologic surgeries.},

  abstract = {The still-growing field of additive manufacturing (AM), which includes 3D printing, has enabled manufacturing of patient-specific medical devices with high geometrical accuracy in a relatively quick manner. However, the development of materials with specific properties is still ongoing, including those for enhanced bone-repair applications. Such applications seek materials with tailored mechanical properties close to bone tissue and, importantly, that can serve as temporary supports, allowing for new bone ingrowth while the material is resorbed. Thus, controlling the resorption rate of materials for bone applications can support bone healing by balancing new tissue formation and implant resorption. In this regard, this work aimed to study the combination of polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL) and hydroxyapatite (HA) to develop customized biocompatible and bioresorbable polymer-based composite filaments, through extrusion, for fused filament fabrication (FFF) printing. PLA and PCL were used as supporting polymer matrices while HA was added to enhance the biological activity. The materials were characterized in terms of mechanical properties, thermal stability, chemical composition and morphology. An accelerated degradation study was executed to investigate the impact of degradation on the above-mentioned properties. The results showed that the materials' chemical compositions were not affected by the extrusion nor the printing process. All materials exhibited higher mechanical properties than human trabecular bone, even after degradation with a mass loss of around 30\% for the polymer blends and 60\% for the composites. It was also apparent that the mineral accelerated the polymer degradation significantly, which can be advantageous for a faster healing time, where support is required only for a shorter time period.},

  abstract = {In this work, the effectiveness of seven commercial compatibilizers is tested in polylactide (PLA)/poly(𝝐-caprolactone) (PCL) blends with different compositions to obtain a high-impact PLA. None of the compatibilizers is effective for 90/10 and 80/20 PLA/PCL compositions, as no improvement of the impact strength is observed. For the 70/30 composition, compatibilizers having glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and acrylate groups in their structure are proved the most effective, as the morphological change towards co-continuity induced by them leads to significant impact strength improvements (of ≈345\% and 90\% with respect to the neat PLA and the noncompatibilized PLA/PCL 70/30 blend, respectively). The 70/30 PLA/PCL composition, as it shows the best balance of properties, and the best compatibilizer (ElvaloyPTW) are chosen to carry out the optimization of the compatibilizer content. It is found that adding 6 phr to the blend results in highly toughened and ductile blends while maintaining a high modulus and yield strength values. Larger compatibilizer contents lead to even higher impact strength values, but the low-strain mechanical properties are notably reduced. Thus, in this work, a simple and easily scalable method to produce high-impact PLA is shown, as it implies the compounding of three commercially available components without involving any toxic solvents.},

  abstract = {The most common three-dimensional (3D) printing method is material extrusion, where a pre-made filament is deposited layer-by-layer. In recent years, low-cost polycaprolactone (PCL) material has increasingly been used in 3D printing, exhibiting a sufficiently high quality for consideration in cranio-maxillofacial reconstructions. To increase osteoconductivity, prefabricated filaments for bone repair based on PCL can be supplemented with hydroxyapatite (HA). However, few reports on PCL/HA composite filaments for material extrusion applications have been documented. In this study, solvent-free fabrication for PCL/HA composite filaments (HA 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, and 25\% weight/weight PCL) was addressed, and parameters for scaffold fabrication in a desktop 3D printer were confirmed. Filaments and scaffold fabrication temperatures rose with increased HA content. The pore size and porosity of the six groups’ scaffolds were similar to each other, and all had highly interconnected structures. Six groups’ scaffolds were evaluated by measuring the compressive strength, elastic modulus, water contact angle, and morphology. A higher amount of HA increased surface roughness and hydrophilicity compared to PCL scaffolds. The increase in HA content improved the compressive strength and elastic modulus. The obtained data provide the basis for the biological evaluation and future clinical applications of PCL/HA material.},

  abstract = {Postoperative pancreatic leakage due to pancreatitis in patients is a life-threatening surgical complication. The majority of commercial barriers are unable to meet the demands for pancreatic leakage due to poor adhesiveness, toxicity, and inability to degrade. In this study, we fabricated mitomycin-c and thrombin-loaded multifunctional dual-layer nanofibrous membrane with a combination of alginate, PCL, and gelatin to resolve the leakage due to suture line disruption, promote hemostasis, wound healing, and prevent postoperative tissue adhesion. Electrospinning was used to fabricate the dual-layer system. The study results demonstrated that high gelatin and alginate content in the inner layer decreased the fiber diameter and water contact angle, and crosslinking allowed the membrane to be more hydrophilic, making it highly biodegradable, and adhering firmly to the tissue surfaces. The results of in vitro biocompatibility and hemostatic assay revealed that the dual-layer had a higher cell proliferation and showed effective hemostatic properties. Moreover, the in vivo studies and in silico molecular simulation indicated that the dual layer was covered at the wound site, prevented suture disruption and leakage, inhibited hemorrhage, and reduced postoperative tissue adhesion. Finally, the study results proved that dual-layer multifunctional nanofibrous membrane has a promising therapeutic potential in preventing postoperative pancreatic leakage.},

  number   = {18},
  abstract = {Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) is a hydrophobic, resorbable aliphatic polymer recognized for its low tenacity and extensive elongation at break, making it a popular choice for fabricating biodegradable tissue engineering scaffolds. PCL's slow degradation rate typically results in a complete resorption period of 2 to 3 years. While numerous studies have examined the degradation of PCL in various forms such as films and webs, no study to date has investigated its physiological degradation in multifilament yarn form. In this study, we subjected PCL multifilament yarn samples to physiological conditions in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) maintained at a consistent temperature of 37 ± 2 • C and agitated at 45 rpm for a period of 32 weeks. We retrieved samples at five different intervals to analyze the degradation profile of the multifilament yarn. This allowed us to estimate the complete resorption time and rate under these in vitro conditions. Over the 32-week period, the multifilament yarn's mass decreased by 4.8\%, its elongation at break declined by 42\%, the tenacity dropped by 40\%, and the peak load at break fell by 46.5\%. Based on these findings, we predict that a scaffold structure incorporating PCL multifilament yarn would undergo complete resorption in approximately 14 months under physiological conditions, such as in PBS solution at a pH of approximately 7 and a temperature of 37 • C.},

  journal  = {Computers in Biology and Medicine},
  volume   = {165},
  abstract = {Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type worldwide. Given high survivorship, increased focus has been placed on long-term treatment outcomes and patient quality of life. While breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is the preferred treatment strategy for early-stage breast cancer, anticipated healing and breast deformation (cosmetic) outcomes weigh heavily on surgeon and patient selection between BCS and more aggressive mastectomy procedures. Unfortunately, surgical outcomes following BCS are difficult to predict, owing to the complexity of the tissue repair process and significant patient-to-patient variability. To overcome this challenge, we developed a predictive computational mechanobiological model that simulates breast healing and deformation following BCS. The coupled biochemical-biomechanical model incorporates multi-scale cell and tissue mechanics, including collagen deposition and remodeling, collagen-dependent cell migration and contractility, and tissue plastic deformation. Available human clinical data evaluating cavity contraction and histopathological data from an experimental porcine lumpectomy study were used for model calibration. The computational model was successfully fit to data by optimizing biochemical and mechanobiological parameters through Gaussian process surrogates. The calibrated model was then applied to define key mechanobiological parameters and relationships influencing healing and breast deformation outcomes. Variability in patient characteristics including cavity-to-breast volume percentage and breast composition were further evaluated to determine effects on cavity contraction and breast cosmetic outcomes, with simulation outcomes aligning well with previously reported human studies. The proposed model has the potential to assist surgeons and their patients in developing and discussing individualized treatment plans that lead to more satisfying post-surgical outcomes and improved quality of life.},

Accordingly, this paper is aimed at reviewing the mechanics of the normal breast. First, the anatomy of the breast and major aging-related changes are described. Second, the mechanical characteristics of all tissue components of the breast are detailed. Last, analytical approximations are made in regard to the forces acting on the breast during normal activity, and the respective internal breast forces supported by the suspensory ligaments, pectoralis fascia and ribs are calculated. The data presented in this paper are useful for biomechanical modeling of the breast as well as for evaluating the loads acting on surgical repairs and breast implants.}

  abstract = {The amount of breast compression that is applied during mammography potentially influences image quality and the discomfort experienced. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between applied compression force, breast thickness, reported discomfort and image quality. Participants were women attending routine breast screening by mammography at BreastScreen New South Wales Central and Eastern Sydney. During the mammographic procedure, an 'extra' craniocaudal (CC) film was taken at a reduced level of compression ranging from 10 to 30 Newtons. Breast thickness measurements were recorded for both the normal and the extra CC film. Details of discomfort experienced, cup size, menstrual status, existing breast pain and breast problems were also recorded. Radiologists were asked to compare the image quality of the normal and manipulated film. The results indicated that 24\% of women did not experience a difference in thickness when the compression was reduced. This is an important new finding because the aim of breast compression is to reduce breast thickness. If breast thickness is not reduced when compression force is applied then discomfort is increased with no benefit in image quality. This has implications for mammographic practice when determining how much breast compression is sufficient. Radiologists found a decrease in contrast resolution within the fatty area of the breast between the normal and the extra CC film, confirming a decrease in image quality due to insufficient applied compression force.}

Localized drug-eluting implants have gained traction as an alternative to overcome the limitations of systemic chemotherapy. This work describes the development of biodegradable 3D printed (3DP) bilayer films loaded with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and cisplatin (Cis) with different infill percentages where the 5FU layers were 40\%, 30\%, and 30\% and Cis layers were 10\%, 15\%, and 10\% for films A, B, and C, respectively. The relevant characterization tests were performed, and the drug content of films was 0.68, 0.50, and 0.50 mg of 5FU and 0.39, 0.80, and 0.34 mg of Cis for films A, B, and C, respectively. Cis release was affected by the alterations to the film design, where films A, B, and C showed complete release at 12, 14, and 23 days, respectively. However, 5FU was released over 24 h for all films. The films were stable for up to two weeks after storage at 25 • C/65\% relative humidity and four weeks at 4 • C where drug content, tensile strength, FTIR, and thermal analysis results demonstrated negligible alterations. The cytotoxicity of the films was assessed by MTS assays using HepG2 cell lines demonstrating up to 81\% reduction in cell viability compared to blank films. Moreover, apoptosis was confirmed by Western Blots and the determination of mitochondrial cell potential, highlighting the potential of these films as a promising approach in adjuvant chemotherapy.},

In this study, we developed a polycaprolactone (PCL) blended with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3D printed scaffold using a rapid prototyping system. The manufactured scaffolds were then washed out to form small pores on the surface in order to improve the scaffolds hydrophilicity. We analyzed the resultant material by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), water absorption, water contact angle, in vitro WST-1, and the Bradford assay. Additionally, cells incubated on the fabricated scaffolds were visualized by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). The developed scaffolds exhibited small pores on the strand surface which served to increase hydrophilicity as well as improve cellular proliferation and increase total protein content. Our findings suggest that the presence of small pores on the scaffolds can be used as an effective tool for improving implant cellular interaction. This research indicates that these modified scaffolds can be considered useful for bone tissue engineering applications to improve human health.},

Methods and Materials: Twenty-two patients underwent tumorectomy with placement of two or more clips in the surgical cavity before breast remodeling. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans, with match-point registration, were performed on all patients. The relationship between the location of the gross tumor volume (GTV), defined on the preoperative scan, and clip clinical target volume (CTV) (clips with a 5-mm margin on the postoperative scan) was then studied, by use of commercial volume analysis software. Results: Of the patients, 4 had two clips, 2 had three clips, 8 had four clips, and 8 had five clips. The median GTV was 1.06 mL (range, 0.2-5.3 mL); clip CTV ranged from 2.4 to 21.5 mL. Volumetric analysis showed that in 7 cases (32\%), there was no intersection between the GTVand the clip CTV, with the following distribution: 4 patients with two clips, 1 patient with three clips, 1 patient with four clips, and 1 patient with five clips. The common contoured volume was defined as the percent ratio between the intersection of the GTV and clip CTV and the GTV. It was found to be significantly increased if three or more clips were used vs. only two clips (common contoured volume, 35.45\% vs. 0.73\%; p = 0.028). Finally, the GTV and clip CTV volume relationship can be presented as follows: 12.5\% to 33\% overlap in 8 patients (36.4\%), 50\% to 75\% in 5 patients (22.7\%), and greater than 90\% in 2 patients (9\%). Conclusions: The use of three or more clips during tumorectomy increases the accuracy of tumor bed delineation.},

  abstract = {Purpose-To evaluate visibility, artifacts, and distortions of various commercial markers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computer tomography (CT), and ultrasound imaging used for radiotherapy planning and treatment guidance. Methods-We compare 2 solid gold markers, 4 gold coils, and 1 polymer marker from 3 vendors. Imaging modalities used were 3-T and 1.5-T GE MRIs, Siemens Sequoia 512 Ultrasound, Phillips Big Bore CT, Varian Trilogy linear accelerator (cone-beam CT [CBCT], onboard imager kilovoltage [OBI-kV], electronic portal imaging device megavoltage [EPID-MV]), and Medtronic O-ARM CBCT. Markers were imaged in a 30 × 30 × 10 cm 3 custom bolus phantom. In one experiment, Surgilube was used around the markers to reduce air gaps. Images were saved in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format and analyzed using an in-house software. Profiles across the markers were used for objective comparison of the markers' signals. The visibility and artifacts/distortions produced by each marker were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results-All markers are visible in CT, CBCT, OBI-kV, and ultrasound. Gold markers below 0.75 mm in diameter are not visible in EPID-MV images. The larger the markers, the more CT and CBCT image artifacts there are, yet the degree of the artifact depends on scan parameters and the scanner itself. Visibility of gold coils of 0.75 mm diameter or larger is comparable across all imaging modalities studied. The polymer marker causes minimal artifacts in CT and CBCT but has poor visibility in EPID-MV. Gold coils of 0.5 mm exhibit poor visibility in MRI and EPID-MV due to their small size. Gold markers are more visible in 3-T T1 gradient-recalled echo than in 1.5-T T1 fast spin-echo, depending on the scan sequence. In this study, all markers are clearly visible on ultrasound. Conclusion-All gold markers are visible in CT, CBCT, kV, and ultrasound; however, only the large diameter markers are visible in MV. When MR and EPID-MV imagers are used, the selection of fiducial markers is not straightforward. For hybrid kV/MV image-guided radiotherapy imaging, larger diameter markers are suggested. If using kV imaging alone, smaller sized markers Reprints and permission: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav},

  abstract = {Materials/Methods: Three hundred thirty-one patients with bilateral breast cancer were treated with radiotherapy of the breast or the thoracic wall between 01/1998 and 12/2008. Synchronous bilateral breast cancer was defined as occurrence of second contralateral tumor within 6 months of diagnosis of first tumor. Median follow-up was 65 months. All endpoints were measured from diagnosis of contralateral breast cancer. Results: Overall survival after 2 and 5 years was 82 \% and 66 \%, local recurrence-free survival 83 \% and 73 \% and metastasis-free survival 77 \% und 60 \%, respectively. Overall survival after 2 and 5 years for patients with synchronous vs. metachronous bilateral breast cancer was 80 \% and 64 \% vs. 84 \% and 67 \%, local recurrence-free survival 85 \% and 79 \% vs. 82 \% and 69 \% and metastasis-free survival 75\% and 65\% vs. 78 \% and 57 \%, respectively. Synchronous or metachronous occurrence of contralateral breast cancer had no impact on further outcome regarding the above mentioned end points (p. 0.05). In patients with metachronous contralateral breast cancer the interval between the two breast cancer events had no impact on further outcome (p. 0.05). Statistically significant impact factors for the whole cohort were application of chemotherapy on overall survival (p = 0.014), age. 60 at time of occurrence of contralateral breast cancer on local recurrence-free survival (p = 0.022), and age. 60 (p = 0.004) and application of chemotherapy on metastasis-free survival (p = 0.050). Conclusions: Patients with synchronous or metachronous bilateral breast cancer do not differ regarding further outcome. However, age at occurrence of contralateral breast cancer has strong impact on local recurrence-free and metastasis-free survival. This may strongly be related to a genetic background in this special cohort of bilateral breast cancer patients.}

  abstract = {For breast boost radiotherapy or accelerated partial breast irradiation, the tumor bed (TB) is delineated by the radiation oncologist on a planning computed tomography (CT) scan. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the interobserver variability (IOV) of the TB delineation is reduced by providing the radiation oncologist with additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scans. A total of 14 T1-T2 breast cancer patients underwent a standard planning CT in the supine treatment position following lumpectomy, as well as additional pre-and postoperative imaging in the same position. Post-lumpectomy TBs were independently delineated by four breast radiation oncologists on standard postoperative CT and on CT registered to an additional imaging modality. The additional imaging modalities used were postoperative MRI, preoperative contrast-enhanced (CE)-CT and preoperative CE-MRI. A cavity visualization score (CVS) was assigned to each standard postoperative CT by each observer. In addition, the conformity index (CI), volume and distance between centers of mass (dCOM) of the TB delineations were calculated. On CT, the median CI was 0.57, with a median volume of 22 cm 3 and dCOM of 5.1 mm. The addition of postoperative MRI increased the median TB volume significantly to 28 cm 3 (P<0.001), while the CI (P=0.176) and dCOM (P=0.110) were not affected. The addition of preoperative CT or MRI increased the TB volume to 26 and 25 cm 3 , respectively (both P<0.001), while the CI increased to 0.58 and 0.59 (both P<0.001) and the dCOM decreased to 4.7 mm (P=0.004) and 4.6 mm (P=0.001), respectively. In patients with CVS≤3, the median CI was 0.40 on CT, which was significantly increased by all additional imaging modalities, up to 0.52, and was accompanied by a median volume increase up to 6 cm 3. In conclusion, the addition of postoperative MRI, preoperative CE-CT or preoperative CE-MRI did not result in a considerable reduction in the IOV in postoperative CT-guided TB delineation, while target volumes marginally increased. The value of additional imaging may be dependent on CVS.},

Methods: Patients with a seroma clarity score (SCS) 3 ~5 and ≥5 surgical clips in the lumpectomy cavity after breast-conserving surgery who were recruited for EB-PBI underwent 4DCT simulation. Based on the ten sets of 4DCT images acquired, the tumour bed formed using the clips, the seroma, and both the clips and seroma (defined as TB C , TB S and TB C+S , respectively) were delineated by five radiation oncologists using specific guidelines. The following parameters were calculated to analyse interobserver variability: volume of the tumour bed (TB C , TB S , TB C+S), coefficient of variation (COV C , COV S , COV C+S), and matching degree (MD C , MD S , MD C+S). Results: The interobserver variability for TB C and TB C+S and for COV C and COV C+S were statistically significant (p = 0.021, 0.008, 0.002, 0.015). No significant difference was observed for TB S and COV S (p = 0.867, 0.061). Significant differences in interobserver variability were observed for MD C vs MD S , MD C vs MD C+S , MD S vs MD C+S (p = 0.000, 0.032, 0.008), the interobserver variability of MD S was smaller than that of MD C and MD C+S (MD S > MD C+S > MD C). Conclusions: When the SCS was 3 ~5 points and the number of surgical clips was ≥5, interobserver variability was minimal for the delineation of the tumour bed based on seroma.},

  abstract = {International consensus has not been reached regarding the optimal number of implanted tumour bed (TB) markers for partial breast/breast boost radiotherapy target volume delineation. Four common methods are: insertion of 6 clips (4 radial, 1 deep and 1 superficial), 5 clips (4 radial and 1 deep), 1 clip at the chest wall, and no clips. We compared TB volumes delineated using 6, 5, 1 and 0 clips in women who have undergone wide-local excision (WLE) of breast cancer (BC) with full-thickness closure of the excision cavity, in order to determine the additional margin required for breast boost or partial breast irradiation (PBI) when fewer than 6 clips are used. Methods: Ten patients with invasive ductal BC who had undergone WLE followed by implantation of six fiducial markers (titanium clips) each underwent CT imaging for radiotherapy planning purposes. Retrospective processing of the DICOM image datasets was performed to remove markers and associated imaging artefacts, using an in-house software algorithm. Four observers outlined TB volumes on four different datasets for each case: (1) all markers present (CT 6M); (2) the superficial marker removed (CT 5M); (3) all but the chest wall marker removed (CT CW); (4) all markers removed (CT 0M). For each observer, the additional margin required around each of TB 0M , TB CW , and TB 5M in order to encompass TB 6M was calculated. The conformity level index (CLI) and differences in centre-of-mass (COM) between observers were quantified for CT 0M , CT CW , CT 5M , CT 6M. Results: The overall median additional margins required to encompass TB 6M were 8 mm (range 0-28 mm) for TB 0M , 5 mm (range 1-13 mm) for TB CW , and 2 mm (range 0-7 mm) for TB 5M. CLI were higher for TB volumes delineated using CT 6M (0.31) CT 5M (0.32) than for CT CW (0.19) and CT 0M (0.15). Conclusions: In women who have undergone WLE of breast cancer with full-thickness closure of the excision cavity and who are proceeding to PBI or breast boost RT, target volume delineation based on 0 or 1 implanted markers is not recommended as large additional margins are required to account for uncertainty over true TB location. Five implanted markers (one deep and four radial) are likely to be adequate assuming the addition of a standard 10-15 mm TB-CTV margin. Low CLI values for all TB volumes reflect the sensitivity of low volumes to small differences in delineation and are unlikely to be clinically significant for TB 5M and TB 6M in the context of adequate TB-CTV margins.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the effect of the time from surgery and other clinical factors on seroma volume and clarity and establish the optimal time to use the computed tomography (CT)-based seroma to plan partial breast irradiation (PBI). Methods and Materials: A total of 205 women with early-stage breast cancer underwent planning CT after breastconserving surgery. One radiation oncologist contoured the seroma volume and scored the seroma clarity, using a standardized Seroma Clarity Score scale, from 0 (not detectable) to 5 (clearest). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the associations between the seroma characteristics and the interval from surgery and other clinical factors. Results: The mean interval from surgery to CT was 84 days (standard deviation 59). During postoperative Weeks 3-8, the mean seroma volume decreased from 47 to 30 cm 3 , stabilized during Weeks 9-14 (mean 21) and was involuted beyond 14 weeks (mean 9 cm 3). The mean seroma clarity score was 3.4 at Weeks 3-8, 2.5 at Weeks 9-14, and 1.6 after 14 weeks. The seroma clarity was greater in patients aged \$70 years. The seroma volume and clarity correlated significantly with the volume of excised breast tissue but not with the maximal tumor diameter, surgical re-excision, or chemotherapy use. Conclusion: The optimal time to obtain the planning CT scan for PBI is within 8 weeks after surgery. During Weeks 9-14, the seroma might remain adequately defined in some patients; however, after 14 weeks, alternate strategies are needed to identify the PBI target. The lack of correlation between the seroma volume and tumor size suggests that the CT-based seroma should not be the sole guide for PBI target volume definition. Ó 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

  title    = {{PLANNING} {TARGET} {VOLUMES} {FOR} {RADIOTHERAPY}: {HOW} {MUCH} {MARGIN} {IS} {NEEDED}?},
  abstract = {Purpose: The radiotherapy planning target volume (PTV) encloses the clinical target volume (CTV) with anisotropic margins to account for possible uncertainties in beam alignment, patient positioning, organ motion, and organ deformation. Ideally, the CTV-PTV margin should be determined solely by the magnitudes of the uncertainties involved. In practice, the clinician usually also considers doses to abutting healthy tissues when deciding on the size of the CTV-PTV margin. This study calculates the ideal size of the CTV-PTV margin when only physical position uncertainties are considered. Methods and Materials: The position of the CTV for any treatment is assumed to be described by independent Gaussian distributions in each of the three Cartesian directions. Three strategies for choosing a CTV-PTV margin are analyzed. The CTV-PTV margin can be based on: 1. the probability that the CTV is completely enclosed by the PTV; 2. the probability that the projection of the CTV in the beam's eye view (BEV) is completely enclosed by the projection of the PTV in the BEV; and 3. the probability that a point on the edge of the CTV is within the PTV. Cumulative probability distributions are derived for each of the above strategies. Results: Expansion of the CTV by 1 standard deviation (SD) in each direction results in the CTV being entirely enclosed within the PTV 24\% of the time; the BEV projection of the CTV is enclosed within the BEV projection of the PTV 39\% of the time; and a point on the edge of the CTV is within the PTV 84\% of the time. To have the CTV enclosed entirely within the PTV 95\% of the time requires a margin of 2.8 SD. For the BEV projection of the CTV to be within the BEV projection of the PTV 95\% of the time requires a margin of 2.45 SD. To have any point on the surface of the CTV be within the PTV 95\% of the time requires a margin of 1.65 SD. Conclusion: In the first two strategies for selecting a margin, the probability of finding the CTV within the PTV is unrelated to dose variations in the CTV. In the third strategy, the specified confidence limit is correlated with the minimum target dose. We recommend that the PTV be calculated from the CTV using a margin of 1.65 SD in each direction. This gives a minimum CTV dose that is greater than 95\% of the minimum PTV dose. Additional sparing of adjoining healthy structures should be accomplished by modifying beam portals, rather than adjusting the PTV. Then, the dose distributions more accurately reflect the clinical compromise between treating the tumor and sparing the patient.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The clinical target volume (CTV) for early stage breast cancer is difficult to clearly identify on planning computed tomography (CT) scans. Surgical clips inserted around the tumour bed should help to identify the CTV, particularly if the seroma has been reabsorbed, and enable tracking of CTV changes over time. Methods: A surgical clip-based CTV delineation protocol was introduced. CTV visibility and its post-operative shrinkage pattern were assessed. The subjects were 27 early stage breast cancer patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy alone and 15 receiving post-operative chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The radiotherapy alone (RT/alone) group received a CT scan at median 25 days post-operatively (CT1rt) and another at 40 Gy, median 68 days (CT2rt). The chemotherapy/RT group (chemo/RT) received a CT scan at median 18 days post-operatively (CT1ch), a planning CT scan at median 126 days (CT2ch), and another at 40 Gy (CT3ch). Results: There was no significant difference (P = 0.08) between the initial mean CTV for each cohort. The RT/alone cohort showed significant CTV volume reduction of 38.4\% (P = 0.01) at 40 Gy. The Chemo/RT cohort had significantly reduced volumes between CT1ch: median 54 cm 3 (4-118) and CT2ch: median 16 cm 3 , (2-99), (P = 0.01), but no significant volume reduction thereafter. Conclusion: Surgical clips enable localisation of the post-surgical seroma for radiotherapy targeting. Most seroma shrinkage occurs early, enabling CT treatment planning to take place at 7 weeks, which is within the 9 weeks recommended to limit disease recurrence.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Inconsistencies in contouring target structures can undermine the precision of conformal radiation therapy (RT) planning and compromise the validity of clinical trial results. This study evaluated the impact of guidelines on consistency in target volume contouring for partial breast RT planning. Methods and Materials: Guidelines for target volume definition for partial breast radiation therapy (PBRT) planning were developed by members of the steering committee for a pilot trial of PBRT using conformal external beam planning. In phase 1, delineation of the breast seroma in 5 early-stage breast cancer patients was independently performed by a "trained" cohort of four radiation oncologists who were provided with these guidelines and an "untrained" cohort of four radiation oncologists who contoured without guidelines. Using automated planning software, the seroma target volume (STV) was expanded into a clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) for each oncologist. Means and standard deviations were calculated, and two-tailed t tests were used to assess differences between the "trained" and "untrained" cohorts. In phase 2, all eight radiation oncologists were provided with the same contouring guidelines, and were asked to delineate the seroma in five new cases. Data were again analyzed to evaluate consistency between the two cohorts. Results: The "untrained" cohort contoured larger seroma volumes and had larger CTVs and PTVs compared with the "trained" cohort in three of five cases. When seroma contouring was performed after review of contouring guidelines, the differences in the STVs, CTVs, and PTVs were no longer statistically significant. Conclusion: Guidelines can improve consistency among radiation oncologists performing target volume delineation for PBRT planning.},

  abstract = {Breast conservation therapy (BCT) is the procedure of choice for the management of the early stage breast cancer. However, its utilization has not been maximized because of logistics issues associated with the protracted treatment involved with the radiation treatment. Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) is an approach that treats only the lumpectomy bed plus a 1-2 cm margin, rather than the whole breast. Hence because of the small volume of irradiation a higher dose can be delivered in a shorter period of time. There has been growing interest for APBI and various approaches have been developed under phase I-III clinical studies; these include multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, balloon catheter brachytherapy, conformal external beam radiation therapy and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). Balloon-based brachytherapy approaches include Mammosite, Axxent electronic brachytherapy and Contura, Hybrid brachytherapy devices include SAVI and ClearPath. This paper reviews the different techniques, identifying the weaknesses and strength of each approach and proposes a direction for future research and development. It is evident that APBI will play a role in the management of a selected group of early breast cancer. However, the relative role of the different techniques is yet to be clearly identified.}

  abstract = {In recent years, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has been considered an alternative to whole breast irradiation for patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy. APBI delivers higher doses of radiation in fewer fractions to the post-lumpectomy tumor bed with a 1-2 cm margin, targeting the area at the highest risk of local recurrence while sparing normal breast tissue. However, there are inherent challenges in defining accurate target volumes for APBI. Studies have shown that significant interobserver variation exists among radiation oncologists defining the lumpectomy cavity, which raises the question of how to improve the accuracy and consistency in the delineation of tumor bed volumes. The combination of standardized guidelines and surgical clips significantly improves an observer's ability in delineation, and it is the standard in multiple ongoing external-beam APBI trials. However, questions about the accuracy of the clips to mark the lumpectomy cavity remain, as clips only define a few points at the margin of the cavity. This paper reviews the techniques that have been developed so far to improve target delineation in APBI delivered by conformal external beam radiation therapy, including the use of standardized guidelines, surgical clips or fiducial markers, pre-operative computed tomography imaging, and additional imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Alternatives to post-operative APBI, future directions, and clinical recommendations were also discussed.},

The clips were visible by imaging modalities such as mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging after implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats. The clips stayed intact in the implantation cavity of the animal for more than 3 months with unpretentious changes in their lengths and morphology. The histopathological examination of implanted clips revealed no signs of systemic toxicity in the rats.

  abstract = {Purpose: To investigate dosimetric implications of biodegradable Biozorb (BZ) markers for proton accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) plans. Materials and Methods: Six different BZs were placed within in-house breast phantoms to acquire computed tomography (CT) images. A contour correction method with proper mass density overriding for BZ titanium clip and surrounding tissue was applied to minimize inaccuracies found in the CT images in the RayStation planning system. Each breast phantom was irradiated by a monoenergetic proton beam (103.23 MeV and 838 cm 2) using a pencil-beam scanning proton therapy system. For a range perturbation study, doses were measured at 5 depths below the breast phantoms by using an ionization chamber and compared to the RayStation calculations with 3 scenarios for the clip density: the density correction method (S1: 1.6 g/cm 3), raw CT (S2), and titanium density (S3: 4.54 g/cm 3). For the local dose perturbation study, the radiographic EDR2 film was placed at 0 and 2 cm below the phantoms and compared to the RayStation calculations. Clinical effects of the perturbations were retrospectively examined with 10 APBI plans for the 3 scenarios (approved by our institutional review board). Results: In the range perturbation study, the S1 simulation showed a good agreement with the chamber measurements, while excess pullbacks of 1~2 mm were found in the S2 and S3 simulations. The film study showed local dose shadowing and perturbation by the clips that RayStation could not predict. In the plan study, no significant differences in the plan quality were found among the 3 scenarios. However, substantial range pullbacks were observed for S3. Conclusion: The density correction method could minimize the dose and range difference between measurement and RayStation prediction. It should be avoided to simply override the known physical density of the BZ clips for treatment planning owing to overestimation of the range pullback.},

  abstract = {Radiotherapy is an integral part of treatment for many patients with breast cancer. However, side effects can occur, e.g., fibrosis or erythema. If patients at higher risks of radiation-induced side effects could be identified before treatment, they could be given more individual information about the risks and benefits of radiotherapy. We hypothesize that breast density is correlated with the risk of side effects and present a novel method for automatic evaluation based on radiotherapy planning CT scans. Methods: 799 supine CT scans of breast radiotherapy patients were available from the REQUITE dataset (www.requite.eu). The methodology was first established in a subset of 114 patients (cohort 1) before being applied to the whole dataset (cohort 2). All patients were scanned in the supine position, with arms up, and the treated breast (ipsilateral) was identified. Manual experts contour available in 96 patients for both the ipsilateral and contralateral breast in cohort 1. Breast tissue was segmented using atlas-based automatic contouring software, ADMIRE® v3.4 (Elekta AB, Sweden). Once validated, the automatic segmentation method was applied to cohort 2. Breast density was then investigated by thresholding voxels within the contours, using Otsu threshold and pixel intensity ranges based on Hounsfield units (-200 to-100 for fatty tissue, and-99 to +100 for fibro-glandular tissue). Volumetric breast density (VBD) was defined as volume of fibro-glandular tissue / (volume of fibro-glandular tissue + volume of fatty tissue). A sensitivity analysis was performed to verify whether calculated VBD was affected by choice of breast contour. In addition, we investigated correlation between volumetric breast density (VBD) and patient age and breast size. VBD values were compared between ipsilateral and contralateral breast contours. Results: Estimated VBD values were 0.40 (range 0.17-0.91) in cohort 1, and 0.43 (0.096-0.99) in cohort 2. We observed ipsilateral breasts to be denser than contralateral breasts. Breast density was negatively associated with breast volume (Spearman: R=-0.5, p-value < 2.2e-16) and age (Spearman: R=-0.24, p-value = 4.6e-10). Conclusion: VBD estimates could be obtained automatically on a large CT dataset. Breast density may not entirely be explained from variables such as patients' age or breast volume. Future work will focus on assessing the usefulness of VBD as a predictive variable for radiation-induced side effects.}

  pages    = {86},
  abstract = {Background: Previous studies suggest the rate of positive surgical margin (PSM) after lumpectomy for breast cancer is approximately 20 \%. The risk of PSM at time of resection is often a source of fear for patients, driving some to elect to undergo mastectomy. This study describes rates and predictors of positive margins for invasive breast cancers in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Materials and methods: From 2004 to 2013, patients with non-metastatic invasive breast cancers who underwent breast conservation surgery were identified from the NCDB. Patients' demographic, clinical, and facility of treatment characteristics were collected and compared. Per SSO-ASTRO-ASCO criteria, margin negative is defined as no gross or microscopic disease (i.e. no tumor on ink). Bivariate tests and multivariate logistic regression were conducted to identify independent predictors of patients with PSM at the time of resection. Results: A total of 707,798 patients were identified with non-metastatic invasive breast tumors who underwent lumpectomy. Rate of PSM across the entire cohort was 5.02 \%. Over time, the rate of PSM decreased significantly from 6.54 \% in 2004 to 3.91 \% in 2013 (p < 0.001). Pure lobular histology predicted for the highest rate of PSM compared with IDC (8.63 vs 4.55 \%; p < 0.001). In adjusted analysis, high grade, non-ductal histology and HER2 amplification were significantly associated with PSM with breast conservation while estrogen and progesterone status were not. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a 5 \% risk of PSM at time of breast conservation surgery using a large, modern national database. Patients with invasive lobular and mixed histology have a nearly twofold risk of PSM compared to invasive ductal cancers. These results provide important data points to help appropriately counsel patients regarding the risk of PSM.},

  journal  = {BMC Cancer},
  volume   = {9},
  number   = {1},
  abstract = {Background: The primary goal of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is to completely excise the tumor and achieve "adequate" or "negative" surgical resection margins while maintaining an acceptable level of postoperative cosmetic outcome. Nevertheless, precise determination of the adequacy of BCS has long been debated. In this regard, the aim of the current paper was to describe a standardized and reproducible methodology for comprehensive and systematic assessment of surgical resection margins during BCS. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 204 BCS procedures performed for invasive breast cancer from August 2003 to June 2007, in which patients underwent a standard BCS resection and systematic sampling of nine standardized re-resection margins (superior, superior-medial, superior-lateral, medial, lateral, inferior, inferior-medial, inferiorlateral, and deep-posterior). Multiple variables (including patient, tumor, specimen, and follow-up variables) were evaluated. Results: 6.4\% (13/204) of patients had positive BCS specimen margins (defined as tumor at inked edge of BCS specimen) and 4.4\% (9/204) of patients had close margins (defined as tumor within 1 mm or less of inked edge but not at inked edge of BCS specimen). 11.8\% (24/204) of patients had at least one re-resection margin containing additional disease, independent of the status of the BCS specimen margins. 7.1\% (13/182) of patients with negative BCS specimen margins (defined as no tumor cells seen within 1 mm or less of inked edge of BCS specimen) had at least one re-resection margin containing additional disease. Thus, 54.2\% (13/24) of patients with additional disease in a re-resection margin would not have been recognized by a standard BCS procedure alone (P < 0.001). The nine standardized resection margins represented only 26.8\% of the volume of the BCS specimen and 32.6\% of the surface area of the BCS specimen. Conclusion: Our methodology accurately assesses the adequacy of surgical resection margins for determination of which individuals may need further resection to the affected breast in order to minimize the potential risk of local recurrence while attempting to limit the volume of additional breast tissue excised, as well as to determine which individuals are not realistically amendable to BCS and instead need a completion mastectomy to successfully remove multifocal disease.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Accurate tumour bed (TB) localisation is a key requirement for the UK IMPORT (Intensity Modulated Partial Organ Radiotherapy) trial. We audited the value of titanium clips for TB localisation following breast conserving surgery (BCS) in breast radiotherapy (RT) planning. Patients and methods: At surgery, paired clips were positioned around the TB as follows: 1. Medial, lateral, superior and inferior: halfway between skin and fascia; 2. Posterior: at the pectoral fascia; 3. Anterior: close to the suture line. Thirty consecutive patients with clips inserted were audited at the time of RT planning. Audit standards were set as follows: (i) 5/6 pairs of clips identified on RT planning computed tomography (CT) scan e 100\%; (ii) possible clip migration: <10\%; (iii) TB localisation improved with clips: >50\%. Inter-and intraobserver variability in clinician outlining of the TB was studied in a subset of 12 randomly selected patients to see if this impacted on positioning of radiotherapy field borders. Results: Five or six pairs of clips were identified in all 30 cases. The TB could be successfully identified using CT seroma alone in only 8/30 (27\%) patients. Clips were essential for the TB localisation of the other 22/30 (73\%) patients. There was no evidence of clip migration. TB localisation led to modified RT field borders in 18/30 (60\%) patients. Five of these patients had highly visible seromas, so the addition of clips modified field borders in 13/30 (43\%) patients. Both inter-and intra-observer variability was reasonable and did not impact on positioning of radiotherapy field borders. Conclusion: Titanium clips provide an accurate and reliable method of TB localisation following BCS. We anticipate that the audit results will lead to clips being adopted as best practice by the Association of Breast Surgeons (ABS) at BASO (British Association of Surgical Oncology).},

The chemical characterisation, electrospinnability, fibrous morphology, degradation rate and interactions with fibroblasts were assessed with respect to copolymers and homopolymers with both lower (around 50,000) and higher (around 95,000) molecular weights. The research investigated commercially available as well as synthesised copolymers. The results revealed that the electrospinnability of polymeric solutions depends on both the molecular weight and the PLA/PCL ratio in the final copolymer. It was determined that PLCL copolymers with a higher content of PCL (!20\%) were not spinnable via the electrospinning process. With the exception of PCL, the resulting fibrous materials were found to be homogeneous and with fibre diameters of slightly more than 1 mm with respect to both the tested molecular weights. The degradation rate was tested under simulation conditions via the utilisation of the lipase and Proteinase K enzymes. The degree of degradation was found to depend on the molecular weight, the crystallinity of the polymer and the specificity of the enzyme applied. While lipase was responsible for the degradation of the PCL polymer, it exerted},

  abstract = {One of the interesting strategies for developing the artificial blood vessels is to generate multi-layered scaffolds for mimicking the structure of native blood vessels such as the intima, media, and adventitia. In this study, we prepared dual-layered poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) scaffolds with micro-and nanofibers as a basic construct of the vessel using electrospinning methods, which was functionalized using a gelatin through acrylic acid (AAc) grafting by γ-ray irradiation. Based on the microfibrous platform (fiber diameter 5 µm), the thickness of the nanofibrous layer (fiber diameter 700 nm) was controlled from 1.1 ± 0.8 to 32.2 ± 1.7 µm, and the mechanical property of the scaffolds was almost maintained despite the increase in thickness of the nanofibrous layer. The successful AAc graft by γ-ray irradiation could allow the gelatin immobilization on the scaffolds. The proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC) on the scaffolds toward a microfibrous layer was approximately 1.3-times greater than in the other groups, and the infiltration was significantly increased, presenting a wide cell distribution in the crosssection. In addition, human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion toward nanofibrous layer was wellmanaged over the entire surface, and the accelerated proliferation was observed on the gelatin-functionalized scaffolds presenting the well-organized gap-junctions. Therefore, our biomimetic dual-layered scaffolds may be the alternative tools for replacing the damaged blood vessels.},

In the last five decades, great advances have been made in the field of biomaterials, including ceramics, glasses, polymers, composites, glass-ceramics and metal alloys. A variety of bioimplants are currently used in either one of the aforesaid forms. Some of these materials are designed to degrade or to be resorbed inside the body rather than removing the implant after its function is served. Many properties such as mechanical properties, non-toxicity, surface modification, degradation rate, biocompatibility, and corrosion rate and scaffold design are taken into consideration. The current review focuses on state-of-the-art biodegradable bioceramics, polymers, metal alloys and a few implants that employ bioresorbable/biodegradable materials. The essential functions, properties and their critical factors are discussed in detail, in addition to their challenges to be overcome.},

  abstract = {The adoption of grammatical modifier for implants or other kinds of biomaterials eventually absorbed by the body has been a long-standing confusing issue, and there are diverse terms in the large fields of research, which not only causes the difficulties when searching on the Internet, but also blurs the meaning and boundaries for researchers. Prior unification attempts at laws/standards set the basis for such research fields towards researching, labeling, marketing and instructions for use. Considering this, the typical grammatical modifiers "biodegradable", "resorbable", "absorbable", along with their noun forms used in the decades of scientific research have been reviewed and explained, interdisciplinary in chemistry, ecology, materials science, biology, microbiology, medicine, and based on usage customs, laws, standards and markets. The term "biodegradable" has been not only used in biomaterials but also in ecology waste management, biomedicine and even natural environment. Meanwhile, the term "resorbable" has long been used in biological reaction (osteoclast driven bone resorption), but is inappropriate for implants that do not carry the potential to grow back into their original form. The term "absorbable" focuses more on the host metabolism to the foreign biodegradation products of the implanted material/device compared with the term "degradable/biodegradable". Meanwhile the coherence and normalization of the term "absorbable" carried by its own in laws and standards contributes as well. In general, the authors consider the term "absorbable" to be the best grammatical modifier with respect to other adjectives which share the same inherence. A further internationally unified usage is proposed by us.},

The effect of blending ratio on the rheology, pore structures, mechanical property, wettability, and biocompatibility of PCL/PLCL blends tubular scaffold are reported. Rheological results show that PCL matrix and PLCL dispersed phase has good compatibility. The melt strength of PCL can be enhanced obviously by adding PLCL. With an increase of PLCL content from 10 to 30 wt\%, the pore size increases from 7.6 to 24.9 μm due to the homogeneous nucleation effect. The maximum open-cell content can reach 77\% for PCL/PLCL foamed sample. Cyclical tensile and compliance tests show that few content of dispersed PLCL (10-20 wt\%) improves the flexibility and recoverability. Cell viability results demonstrate that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured on all PCL/PLCL porous scaffolds exhibit a typical spindle-like cell morphology. Moreover, HUVECs have a higher density and spreading areas on surface of 10\% PLCL scaffold. The results gathered in this paper may open a new perspective for the fabrication of small-diameter vascular tissue engineering scaffold.},

  abstract = {The morphology and melting behavior of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) processed at varying pressure-temperaturetime conditions (2000-20,000 lb f , 22-70 � C, and 5-15 min) were studied using polarized light microscopy (PLM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). Samples processed well below the melting region at 22 � C displayed minimal to no birefringent properties, with broadened crystalline XRD scattering patterns, indicative of plastic crystal mesophase morphology. Plastic crystal quantity was shown to gradually increase from 16\% to 30\% with processing pressure increasing from 2000 lb f to 20,000 lb f. The mechanism of this formation is thought to be the result of crystal disorganization upon plastic deformation, related to the low-energy barrier slip-planes in the crystalline structure. With sufficient chain mobility achieved at higher processing temperatures (50 � C and 60 � C), samples displayed broad birefringent strokes under PLM and were characterized by XRD scattering patterns of broad anisotropic arcs around the equator of the 2D azimuthal pattern, which are indicative of condis crystal mesophase orientation. As opposed to plastic crystal, the condis crystal quantities showed no correlation with increased pressure, ranging between 28\% and 40\% as processing pressure increased. The additional chain mobility at these temperatures is thought to enable the mesophase to orient radially (normal to the direction of the external load), allowing the transition from plastic crystal to condis crystal. Thus, this paper reports the formation of four distinct morphologies upon processing PCL namely; crystalline, condis crystal mesophase, plastic crystal mesophase, and amorphous.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The goal of this work was to develop phantoms for the optimization of pre-operative computed tomography (CT) scans of the prostate artery, which are used for embolization planning. Methods: Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pellets were doped with barium sulfate and extruded into filaments suitable for 3D printing on a fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer. Cylinder phantoms were created to evaluate radiopacity as a function of doping percentage. Small-diameter tree phantoms were created to assess their composition and dimensional accuracy. A half-pelvis phantom was created using clinical CT images, to assess the printer's control over cortical bone thickness and cancellous bone attenuation. CT-derived prostate artery phantoms were created to simulate complex, contrast-filled arteries. Results: A linear relationship (R = 0.998) was observed between barium sulfate added (0\%-10\% by weight), and radiopacity (À31 to 1454 Hounsfield Units [HU]). Micro-CT scans showed even distribution of the particles, with air pockets comprising 0.36\% by volume. The small vessels were found to be oversized by a consistent amount of 0.08 mm. Micro-CT scans revealed that the phantoms' interiors were completely filled in. The maximum HU values of cortical bone in the phantom were lower than that of the filament, a result of CT image reconstruction. Creation of cancellous bone regions with lower HU values, using the printer's infill parameter, was successful. Direct volume renderings of the pelvis and prostate artery were similar to the clinical CT, with the exception that the surfaces of the phantom objects were not as smooth. Conclusions: It is possible to reliably create FDM 3D printer filaments with predictable radiopacity in a wide range of attenuation values, which can be used to print dimensionally accurate radiopaque objects derived from CT data. Phantoms of this type can be quickly and inexpensively developed to assess and optimize CT protocols for specific clinical applications.},

Moreover, electrodes to conduct capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C 4 D) were integrated into the MCE using three conductive thermoplastic filaments containing graphene, carbon black, and copper. After optimizing the parameters for multi-material printing, the MCE-C 4 D device was fabricated in a single (one step) 3D printing process using an FDM 3D printer equipped with two extrusion nozzles. An optimization design method allowed finding that the distance (gap) between the electrodes of around 1 mm provided the maximum response of the C 4 D. The optimized frequency of the excitation signal applied in the C 4 D electrodes depended on the composition of the conductive filament used to print the electrodes. The optimized frequencies for the electrodes printed with thermoplastic polymers containing copper and carbon black were 268 and 384 kHz, respectively. The MCE-C 4 D successfully separated and detected a mixture of K + , Na + , and Li + with good resolution, efficiency, precision, linearity, and limits of detections (LOD) of 10.2, 11.6, and 14.1 µmol L-1 , respectively.},

The recent advancement in this technology like Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) make it rapid manufacturing. However, the manufacturing of ready to use parts using FDM is a challenging task. The processing parameters like infill density, infill pattern, extrusion temperature affect the design, quality, functionality and mechanical properties of the final part vigorously. The present article discusses the effects of material density, infill density and extrusion temperature on tensile strength of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG), and Multi-material test pieces. Multi-material is fabricated by merging 50\% of ABS and 50\% of PETG layer by layer in FDM 3D Printing. A total of 30 test pieces as per the ASTM D638-(IV) standard was printed having different infill density, extrusion temperature, and material density. In addition to this, Infill density and extrusion temperature are optimized for increasing the tensile strength of FDM fabricated units. Artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm-artificial neural network (GA-ANN) hybrid tool in MATLAB-16.0 are used for training and optimization purposes. It is observed that GA-ANN has maximized the tensile strength up to 4.54\% and it has been validated experimentally.},

It has recently found its way into the fi eld of the textile industry and promises to revolutionise the textile supply chain. It is of particular interest for the production of customised items and other structures which cannot be produced with common techniques. Large apparel companies have already integrated 3D printing into their manufacturing processes to print parts like soles and accessories. However, 3D printed garments that are ready to wear can still not be found. Due to the lack of suitable printing materials, research in 3D printed textiles is still in its initial stage. This research contributes to the development of 3D printed textiles by using Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). In this study, a new method for printing textile-like surfaces was developed which combines diff erent materials into an interrelated fl exible structure. Several textile-like surfaces were designed on this basis and fi nally applied to a wearable garment. Furthermore, the advantages of 3D printing for the textile supply chain were demonstrated.},

  abstract  = {In additive manufacturing, there is a necessity to qualify both the geometrical and material characteristics of the fabricated part, because both are being created simultaneously as the part is built up layer by layer. Increased availability of open source fused deposition modeling machines has expanded the parameter space for which the user has control during the build process. This work quantifies the effects of operator choices, such as print speed, printer head and build plate temperatures, layering thickness, or building in a thermally controlled or fully open environment, on the quality and reproducibility of the build. Modal analyses were performed on completed builds using an electrodynamic shaker and integrated circuit piezoelectric accelerometers embedded in the parts during the build process. Experimental measurements of the fused deposition modeled parts were benchmarked against eigenvalue analysis results for an idealized part with homogenous material properties to gauge the suitability of such analysis to fused deposition modeling additive manufacturing. Follow on work will use this embedded technique for state-of-health monitoring in deployed systems and real-time diagnostics and control of the build process.},

  publisher = {Springer International Publishing},
  abstract  = {Additive Manufacturing has opened privileged roads towards rapid-realization of highly customized goods. The most spread AM technology is the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), that allows production of plastic prototypes and finished parts. Among these opportunities, the FDM technology offers the possibility of printing objects made up of different materials (Multi-Material-Deposition) to create objects characterized by local variations of compliance. This capability can be exploited to generate flexible joints that connect more rigid portions of the same object, enabling finite relative movement between portions of the object. In other words, it is possible to realize monolithic and joint-less structures that rely on the compliance of specifically designed zones to govern motion and forces transfer, i.e. the so called Compliant Mechanisms. This paper presents the design process of such a flexible junction, and how it is possible to embed a distributed sensor (i.e. an optical fiber) within it in order to measure the junction deformation and, then, read the relative movement of the two elements connected to it. The control of this type of systems, in fact, is always problematic because of the intrinsic 'uncertainty in the elasticity and mass density of the links', that can make open loop control systems prone to instability. Furthermore, the presented and discussed embedding technique can be also adopted to embed sensors in other types of applications.},

  title    = {Embedding of {SMD} populated circuits into {FDM} printed objects},
  abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of a highly integrated 3D-printing device which is capable of printing plastic parts with integrated, fully assembled electronic circuits in a single process. It is based on a standard FDM 3D-printer that has been augmented by a screw-driven conductive paste extruder for electronic circuit printing, a vacuum nozzle to pick and place SMD-components and a vision system to find and precisely align the components before placing. To control the printer, an existing host software system has been extended to synchronize the communication with the printer for interactive operations and to generate the required movements from camera data by means of image processing. A number of objects, containing circuits on both the surface and inside of the object, has been successfully printed already. Quality and durability of the generated parts have been evaluated by analyzing the curing characteristics of the conductive ink during the process and the adhesion of the components which are placed directly on the wet ink. The design concept aims for a practical, affordable approach that can be widely used by developers to lower the entrance barrier to the field of 3D-printed electronics. Hence, the hardware is kept as simple as possible, avoiding complex and expensive components as laser or CNC-milling devices, focusing on algorithmic improvements in the preprocessing and control software. All developed hard-and software-components are available under open source licenses and compatible to common existing projects.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have been successfully applied in various applications. Fused deposition modeling (FDM), one of the most popular AM techniques, is the most widely used method for fabricating thermoplastic parts those are mainly used as rapid prototypes for functional testing with advantages of low cost, minimal wastage, and ease of material change. Due to the intrinsically limited mechanical properties of pure thermoplastic materials, there is a critical need to improve mechanical properties for FDM-fabricated pure thermoplastic parts. One of the possible methods is adding reinforced materials (such as carbon fibers) into plastic materials to form thermoplastic matrix carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites those could be directly used in the actual application areas, such as aerospace, automotive, and wind energy. This paper is going to present FDM of thermoplastic matrix CFRP composites and test if adding carbon fiber (different content and length) can improve the mechanical properties of FDM-fabricated parts. The CFRP feedstock filaments were fabricated from plastic pellets and carbon fiber powders for FDM process. After FDM fabrication, effects on the tensile properties (including tensile strength, Young's modulus, toughness, yield strength, and ductility) and flexural properties (including flexural stress, flexural modulus, flexural toughness, and flexural yield strength) of specimens were experimentally investigated. In order to explore the parts fracture reasons during tensile and flexural tests, fracture interface of CFRP composite specimens after tensile testing and flexural testing was observed and analyzed using SEM micrograph.},

  abstract = {Due to the simplicity and accessibility of the 3D printing FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology, it has gained many followers, turning into a real industry. Thus, with the appearance of numerous manufacturers of 3D printers, they have become affordable serial products. Access to numerous open source CAD design programs and databases with ready-to-use projects have allowed the use of technology in production applications and prototyping in the most diverse fields, but also for the creation of final products for household use. The most commonly used thermoplastic materials in 3D printing are polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), thermoplastic urethane (TPU), and nylon [1]. Among them, polylactic acid stands out, being a biodegradable and recyclable polymer with multiple applications and the most used filament for 3D printing [2]. The judicious use of biodegradable raw materials contributes significantly to the effort to reduce the impact on the environment and to sustainable development. The increasingly widespread use of 3D printing also involves the generation of increasing amounts of PLA waste, and by recycling and reducing it we can contribute to lowering costs, reducing the demand for virgin raw materials and reducing the environmental impact. In this paper we will study the influence of the shredding dimensions of PLA waste prepared for extrusion on the characteristics of the obtained filament.},

However, preclinical evaluation of biodegradable materials can be challenging, since they are located in close contact with host tissues and might be implanted for a long period of time. Evaluation of these compounds requires biodegradability and biocompatibility studies and meticulous pathology examination. We describe 2 preclinical studies performed on Sprague-Dawley rats for 52 weeks, to evaluate clinical pathology, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and systemic toxicity after implantation of 2-layered films or saline-inflated balloon-shaped implants of downsized InSpace™ devices (termed “test device”). The test devices are made from a copolymer of poly-l-lactide-co-∊-caprolactone in a 70:30 ratio, identical to the device used in humans, intended for the treatment of rotator cuff tears. Intra-articular film implantation and subcutaneous implantation of the downsized device showed favorable local and systemic tolerability. Although the implanted materials have no inherent toxic or tumorigenic properties, one animal developed a fibrosarcoma at the implantation site, an event that is associated with a rodent-predilection response where solid materials cause mesenchymal neoplasms. This effect is discussed in the context of biodegradable materials along with a detailed description of expected pathology for biodegradable materials in long-term rodent studies.</p>},

  abstract = {During the additive manufacturing "boom" of the last decade, consumer level 3D printers have kept pace with commercial/industrial printers, both in numbers and features. However, in material characterization data, the access to date for the consumer has significantly lagged behind. Consumer level 3D printers provide a significant asset to entrepreneurs, small businesses, universities, college students, and hobbyists due to the low initial capital cost and relatively low operational costs. Commercial grade 3D printers and the associated filaments sold for their use typically have well documented material properties and print parameters. Consumer 3D printers, however, typically have limited or no access to mechanical test data for their materials. This paper describes the work of the authors to fill the existing knowledge gap in the mechanical properties of consumer level 3D printer filament. ASTM Tensile (D638) tests were performed on samples produced by two commercially available 3D printers. The materials tested include PLA, ABS, PETG, various nylons, Polycarbonate/ABS, and ASA filaments. Samples were printed with infill percentages ranging from 15\% to 100\% to test for tensile properties.}

  abstract = {Knowledge on the forces acting on a woman's breast and on the mechanical properties of the breast tissues is important for studying the effects of plastic surgery techniques for breast reconstruction as well as for the design of cosmetic breast implants. Surprisingly, there are no data in the literature regarding mechanical loads on the breast tissues during daily or sport activities, and there are no coherent sources of data in regard to mechanical properties of the breast tissues. Accordingly, this paper is aimed at reviewing the mechanics of the normal breast. First, the anatomy of the breast and major aging-related changes are described. Second, the mechanical characteristics of all tissue components of the breast are detailed. Last, analytical approximations are made in regard to the forces acting on the breast during normal activity, and the respective internal breast forces supported by the suspensory ligaments, pectoralis fascia and ribs are calculated. The data presented in this paper are useful for biomechanical modeling of the breast as well as for evaluating the loads acting on surgical repairs and breast implants.},

More than 70\% of breast cancer recurrences are localized to the original tumor cavity. Hence, targeted radiation therapy after lumpectomy is critical for recurrence prevention. With 30,000 patients annually opting for oncoplastic reconstruction of the breast after lumpectomy to improve cosmesis, the resulting tissue rearrangement increases the difficulty for radiation oncologists to accurately delineate the cavity when planning radiation therapy. Owing to the absence of a standardized protocol, it is important to assess the efficacy of various methods used to mark the tumor cavity for improved delineation.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women all over the world. The prognosis is generally good, with a five-year overall survival rate above 90\% for all stages. It is still the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women. Surgical treatment of breast cancer has changed dramatically over the years. Initially, treatment involved major surgery with long hospitalization, but it is now mostly accomplished as an outpatient procedure with a quick recovery. Thanks to well-designed retrospective and randomly controlled prospective studies, guidelines are continually changing. We are presently in an era where safely de-escalating surgery is increasingly emphasized. Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease, where a “one-size-fits-all” treatment approach is not appropriate. There is often more than one surgical solution carrying equal oncological safety for an individual patient. In these situations, it is important to include the patient in the treatment decision-making process through well informed consent. For this to be optimal, the physician must be fully updated on the surgical options. A consequence of an improved prognosis is more breast cancer survivors, and therefore physical appearance and quality of life is more in focus. Modern breast cancer treatment is increasingly personalized from a surgical point of view but is dependent on a multidisciplinary approach. Detailed algorithms for surgery of the breast and the axilla are required for optimal treatment and quality control. This review illustrates how breast cancer treatment has changed over the years and how the current standard is based on high quality scientific research.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED To accurately mimic the native tissue environment, tissue engineered scaffolds often need to have a highly controlled and varied display of three-dimensional (3D) architecture and geometrical cues. Additive manufacturing in tissue engineering has made possible the development of complex scaffolds that mimic the native tissue architectures. As such, architectural details that were previously unattainable or irreproducible can now be incorporated in an ordered and organized approach, further advancing the structural and chemical cues delivered to cells interacting with the scaffold. This control over the environment has given engineers the ability to unlock cellular machinery that is highly dependent upon the intricate heterogeneous environment of native tissue. Recent research into the incorporation of physical and chemical gradients within scaffolds indicates that integrating these features improves the function of a tissue engineered construct. This review covers recent advances on techniques to incorporate gradients into polymer scaffolds through additive manufacturing and evaluate the success of these techniques. As covered here, to best replicate different tissue types, one must be cognizant of the vastly different types of manufacturing techniques available to create these gradient scaffolds. We review the various types of additive manufacturing techniques that can be leveraged to fabricate scaffolds with heterogeneous properties and discuss methods to successfully characterize them. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE Additive manufacturing techniques have given tissue engineers the ability to precisely recapitulate the native architecture present within tissue. In addition, these techniques can be leveraged to create scaffolds with both physical and chemical gradients. This work offers insight into several techniques that can be used to generate graded scaffolds, depending on the desired gradient. Furthermore, it outlines methods to determine if the designed gradient was achieved. This review will help to condense the abundance of information that has been published on the creation and characterization of gradient scaffolds and to provide a single review discussing both methods for manufacturing gradient scaffolds and evaluating the establishment of a gradient.},

Research in materials has led to the development of polymers with advantageous characteristics for mechanics and biocompatibility, with tuning of mechanical properties achieved by altering printing process parameters. Suitable polymer printing processes include extrusion, resin, and powder 3D printing, which enable directed material deposition for the design of advantageous and customized architectures. Design strategies, such as hierarchical distribution of materials, enable balancing of conflicting properties, such as mechanical and biological needs for tissue scaffolds. Further medical applications reviewed include safety equipment, dental implants, and drug delivery systems, with findings suggesting a need for improved design methods to navigate the complex decision space enabled by 3D printing. Further research across these areas will lead to continued improvement of 3D-printed design performance that is essential for advancing frontiers across engineering and medicine.},

This was majorly due to the lack of 3D printable materials possessing mechanical properties similar to the native tissue. In this study, we have synthesized four different ratios of poly(caprolactone-co-lactide (PLCL) and tested their 3D printing capabilities. The physicochemical properties of the material were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Furthermore, the mechanical properties were assessed using the universal testing machine (UTM). The ratio with the higher lactide content was found to have better printability. Out of the different ratios assessed, a suitable ratio having the desired mechanical properties and printability was identified and 3D printed into a tracheal scaffold. Thus, PLCL can be a potential material for 3D printing of tissues like the trachea.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION With the introduction of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and the trend of reducing the number of fractions, the geometric accuracy of treatment delivery becomes critical. APBI patient setup is often based on fiducials, as the seroma is frequently not visible on pretreatment imaging. We assessed the motion of fiducials relative to the tumor bed between planning CT and treatment, and calculated margins to compensate for this motion. METHODS A cohort of seventy patients treated with APBI on a Cyberknife was included. Planning and in-room pretreatment CT scans were registered on the tumor bed. Residual motion of the centers of mass of surgical clips and interstitial gold markers was calculated. We calculated the margins required per desired percentage of patients with 100\% CTV coverage, and the systematic and random errors for fiducial motion. RESULTS For a single fraction treatment, a margin of 1.8 mm would ensure 100\% CTV coverage in 90\% of patients when using surgical clips for patient set-up. When using interstitial markers, the margin should be 2.2 mm. The systematic and random errors were 0.46 mm for surgical clip motion and 0.60 mm for interstitial marker motion. No clinical factors were found predictive for fiducial motion. CONCLUSIONS Fiducial motion relative to the tumor bed between planning CT and APBI treatment is non-negligible and should be included in the PTV margin calculation to prevent geographical miss. Systematic and random errors of fiducial motion were combined with other geometric uncertainties to calculate comprehensive PTV margins for different treatment techniques.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND As a surrogate for the breast tumor bed, individual fiducial markers frequently move during radiotherapy. This study aimed to classify the motions and calculate the individualized target margin. METHODS The mammary basal diameters (D) and heights (H) were measured to represent breast sizes for 15 patients after breast-conserving surgery. The clinical target volume (CTV) was divided into 4 quadrants by a coordinate system with the center of mass of the tumor bed as the origin. The lateral, anteroposterior, and craniocaudal motions of markers were calculated (MLR, MAP, MSI) based on the difference of the setup errors between the spine matching and the fiducial markers matching. The distances between markers and the innermost, foremost, and uppermost borders of CTV (DSLR, DSAP, DSSI) were recorded. RESULTS In the first quadrant, MAP was strongly correlated with D×H (r>0.80) when D×H <99.89 cm2. Both MLR and MAP were positively linearly related to DSLR, DSAP, DSSI (r>0.85, R2>0.75). MSI was also positively linearly correlated with DSAP and DSLR (r>0.90, R2>0.80). In the fourth quadrant with D×H <90.71 cm2, only MLR and DSLR showed a linear positive correlation (r>0.90, R2>0.75), whereas the others showed linear negative correlations (r>-0.90, R2>0.80). The planning target volume (PTV) margin varied significantly between the first and fourth quadrant (P<0.05), and the largest margin was 12.4 mm in the craniocaudal direction of the first quadrant with D×H ≥99.89 cm2. CONCLUSIONS Fiducial motion is susceptible to breast size and fiducial position, and the individualized PTV margins should take the above factors into account.},

  abstract = {BioZorb fiducial marker is an implantable device made of six clips to mark the surgical site of tissue removal in three dimensions. The marker facilitates focused radiation therapy, while allowing for tissue ingrowth during the healing process with resorption by the body overtime. Current literature investigating the use of the BioZorb is limited and focused on its value for radiation treatment. Our objective was to investigate the feasibility and surgical complications associated with the BioZorb in breast-conserving surgery. From April 2015 to June 2018, 89 patients who underwent 91 partial mastectomies with planned adjuvant radiation therapy and placement of the BioZorb. Demographics, type of BioZorb used, complication rate, and postoperative examinations were analyzed. A total of 89 patients who were a median age of 59 years (range 34-84) underwent 91 operations with BioZorb placement-86.8\% underwent a partial mastectomy (n = 79), and 13.2\% underwent a breast wide re-excision for margins at the time of BioZorb placement (n = 12). Of the 79 partial mastectomies, 21.5\% (n = 17) were palpable tumors. Location of the tumor and subsequent BioZorb placement was most often in the upper outer quadrant (40.7\%), followed by upper inner (27.5\%), lower outer (20.9\%), and lower inner quadrants (10.9\%). 92.3\% (n = 84) had a single BioZorb placed, 5.5\% (n = 5) had two BioZorbs placed in a single lumpectomy cavity, and 2.2\% (n = 2) had two BioZorbs placed in separate lumpectomy cavities of the same breast. Of the 10 different tissue marker sizes used, a 2 × 3 cm BioZorb was most commonly used (37/98, 37.8\%), followed by 3 × 4 cm (25/98, 25.5\%) and 1 × 3 × 2 (9/98, 9.2\%). A total of five patients underwent immediate bilateral breast reduction following placement of the BioZorb. Of the 91 operations, 22 patients had a subsequent reoperation for positive margins after initial placement of the BioZorb, of which 86.4\% retained the BioZorb. During these reoperations, only 1 patient had the BioZorb removed due to discomfort (4.5\%) and two had it removed due to subsequent mastectomy (9.1\%). At a median time of 1.1 years, the BioZorb continued to be palpable on clinical breast examination in 63.6\% of patients. The longest time that the BioZorb continued to be palpable was 2.8 years. Additional imaging was ordered because a clinician palpated a mass, unaware it was the BioZorb 8.8\% of the time (n = 8). Thirty-day complications include 3.3\% of patients with an infection requiring antibiotics (n = 3) and 2.2\% with an abscess requiring aspiration and antibiotics without removal of the BioZorb. One patient had migration of the BioZorb from the breast to the axilla which resulted in surgical explant at 9 months post-op. BioZorb is feasible to use in breast-conserving surgery with few short- and long-term complications, but will result in a palpable mass that may persist for more than 1 year. Explantation is rare.},

Implants with complex porous structures can be fabricated by printing to tune mechanical behavior and enable diffusion, consequently improving integration with tissues in the human body. Poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) is a 3D-printable polymer that possess a wide range of possible mechanical properties depending on its monomer composition. It is often used in biomedical applications requiring degradability. In this study, we explore 1) the effect of annealing 3D-printed PLCL and 2) the degradation profile of both annealed and unannealed 3D-printed PLCL scaffolds. The degraded samples were characterized for its molecular weight, mass loss, microstructure, and mechanical properties. By annealing the 3D-printed PLCL, we reveal the structure-property relationship of PLCL. Crystallization was found to be a crucial factor in the resulting mechanical properties, increasing stiffness significantly. The subsequent degradation study revealed that there was no significant difference brought about by pre-annealing the scaffolds. The scaffolds were found to maintain their mechanical properties until up to 8 weeks, at which point the scaffolds reached a critical molecular weight and lost their mechanical integrity.},

  abstract = {Poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds have been used in regenerative medicine, however, they commonly suffer from low flexibility, restricting their application in the repair and reconstruction of soft tissues. In this study, poly(l-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) copolymers were examined to modulate the elasticity of PLLA with the random presence of CL units in PLLA. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the introduction of PCL could significantly decrease the melting point and glass transition temperature of PLLA, benefiting the extrusion and printing of PLCL. Diverse scaffolds with designed architectures including porous cubes with or without large holes, cambered plates with holes and round tubes could be easily constructed by 3D printing. In the process of elastic deformation, the maximum elastic stress of the copolymer scaffold was obviously increased from 19.6 to 31.5 MPa when the relative content of PCL was increased to 70\%, while the elongation at break was evidently increased from 388\% to about 1974\%. The Young's modulus of PLCL was also significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in comparison with that of PLLA. PLCL scaffolds have good platelet and endotheliocyte adhesion ability and no obvious hemolysis was observed. In vivo subcutaneous implantation of PLCL scaffolds demonstrated superior biocompatibility. Collectively, this work highlights that copolymerization of PCL segments into PLLA is an effective approach to tune the 3D printability and the stiffness and elasticity of PLLA scaffolds. PLCL scaffolds hold great promise for the regeneration of soft tissues including but not limited to cartilage, myocardium, muscle, tendon and nervous tissues.},

These balloon implants act as a temporary spacer for tissues, while reducing pain and allowing rehabilitation after surgery. It is essential to ensure that each balloon fulfill two requirements after implantation: (1) display a well-defined degradation profile, and (2) remain unaffected by premature rapture or leakage. Storage also affects the stability of a polymer-based implant. Since the balloons are implanted into humans, it is essential to understand their in vitro and in vivo degradation along with their physicochemical properties. It is unpredictable if balloon storage on their performance. Therefore, the in vitro and in vivo degradation behavior of PLCL balloons was examined during one year, and the information obtained was used to correlate reliability under prolonged storage conditions. We investigated changes in weight, melting temperature (T m), molecular weight distribution (M w , M n and PDI), crystallinity (Χ), optical activity [α], and inherent viscosity (η) of the balloons during the entire degradation time. We also examined the molecular properties of the balloons under annealing and extreme temperature conditions, such as the combined effect of temperature and humidity that simulate various storage conditions. We have concluded that degradation of the PLCL balloons is slow, and they remain stable during the test period. Results reveal that the balloons retain their molecular properties under long-term storage, annealing, and extreme temperature conditions. The balloons did not show any variation from reference samples, and they exhibited a constant stability profile even after shelfstorage of more than 3 years. These findings can serve as a case study for evaluating various other biodegradable materials.},

  abstract = {The inhalation of particles and their exposure to the bronchi and alveoli constitute a major public health risk. Chemical as well as particle-related properties are important factors for the biological response but are difficult to separate from each other. Barium sulfate is a completely inert chemical compound, therefore it is ideally suited to separate these two factors. The biological response of rat alveolar macrophages (NR8383) was analyzed after exposure to barium sulfate particles with three different diameters (40 nm, 270 nm, and 1.3 mm, respectively) for 24 h in vitro (particle concentrations from 12.5 to 200 mg mL À1). The particles were colloidally stabilized as well as fluorescently-labeled by carboxymethylcellulose, conjugated with 6-aminofluorescein. All kinds of barium sulfate particles were efficiently taken up by NR8383 cells and found inside endo-lysosomes, but never in the cell nucleus. Neither an inflammatory nor a cytotoxic response was detected by the ability of dHL-60 and NR8383 cells to migrate towards a chemotactic gradient (conditioned media of NR8383 cells) and by the release of inflammatory mediators (CCL2, TNF-a, IL-6). The particles neither caused apoptosis (up to 200 mg mL À1) nor necrosis (up to 100 mg mL À1). As only adverse reaction, necrosis was found at a concentration of 200 mg mL À1 of the largest barium sulfate particles (1.3 mm). Barium sulfate particles are ideally suited as bioinert control to study size-dependent effects such as uptake mechanisms of intracellular distributions of pure particles, especially in nanotoxicology.},

  title    = {No inflammatory effects after acute inhalation of barium sulfate particles in human volunteers},
  journal  = {BMC Pulmonary Medicine},
  volume   = {22},
  number   = {1},
  abstract = {Background: Most threshold limit values are based on animal experiments. Often, the question remains whether these data reflect the situation in humans. As part of a series of investigations in our exposure lab, this study investigates whether the results on the inflammatory effects of particles that have been demonstrated in animal models can be confirmed in acute inhalation studies in humans. Such studies have not been conducted so far for barium sulfate particles (BaSO 4), a substance with very low solubility and without known substance-specific toxicity. Previous inhalation studies with zinc oxide (ZnO), which has a substance-specific toxicity, have shown local and systemic inflammatory respones. The design of these human ZnO inhalation studies was adopted for BaSO 4 to compare the effects of particles with known inflammatory activity and supposedly inert particles. For further comparison, in vitro investigations on inflammatory processes were carried out. Methods: Sixteen healthy volunteers were exposed to filtered air and BaSO 4 particles (4.0 mg/m 3) for two hours including one hour of ergometric cycling at moderate workload. Effect parameters were clinical signs, body temperature, and inflammatory markers in blood and induced sputum. In addition, particle-induced in vitro-chemotaxis of BaSO 4 was investigated with regard to mode of action and differences between in vivo and in vitro effects. Results: No local or systemic clinical signs were observed after acute BaSO 4 inhalation and, in contrast to our previous human exposure studies with ZnO, no elevated values of biomarkers of inflammation were measured after the challenge. The in vitro chemotaxis induced by BaSO 4 particles was minimal and 15-fold lower compared to ZnO. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that BaSO 4 as a representative of granular biopersistent particles without specific toxicity does not induce inflammatory effects in humans after acute inhalation. Moreover, the in vitro data fit in with these in vivo results. Despite the careful and complex investigations, limitations must be admitted because the number of local effect parameters were limited and chronic toxicity could not be studied.},
